description: Learn how to use JSON Schema to enforce consistent return values for dynamic config rules
---

Dynamic configs support schemas using [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step) syntax to enforce a common convention between the return values for each rule you'll set.

<Info>
Schemas are only enforced when editing dynamic configs through the console or API, and are not used at code runtime.

For example, if you have a dynamic config that returns settings for a site banner, you might have a schema of:
```
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "title": {
      "type": "string",
    },
    "description": {
      "type": "string",
    },
    "cta": {
      "type": "string",
    }
  },
  "required": ["title", "description", "cta"],
}
```

Now, each of your rules must return an object including title, description, and CTA.

## Infer schema from current values

You can also infer schema based on the current values in your targeting rule variations. This is useful as a quick starting point for validations or for documenting the expected shape of your config.

**Important - JSON5 output**

Statsig emits the inferred schema in JSON5 (a superset of JSON). JSON5 allows **unquoted object keys** and trailing commas. This might fail other standard JSON Schema validators and typical unit-test tooling. Statsig accepts JSON5 in the Console and API, but if you want strict JSON for validators or tests you should convert the output.
