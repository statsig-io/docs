Update: Sync Java SDK public API with documentation

You're helping maintain the documentation for the Statsig Java Server SDK.

The Java SDK source code is located in:
- sdk-repo/

The existing public-facing documentation is here:
- docs/server
- docs/server/java

Your task:
- Look through the SDK source code and identify all public classes and methods
- Compare them with what's in the current documentation
- Add any missing methods/classes and remove or update anything that's outdated
- Match the tone and format of the existing documentation
