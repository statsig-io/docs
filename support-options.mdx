Statsig uses automated tooling in the Slack Connect channel to triage and prioritize inbound support messages. All support at Statsig is done by actual, full-time engineers.

While Statsig maintains a monitored support email, we strongly encourage Slack as the primary channel for support and communication to ensure the fastest response times.

Our preferred methods of raising a support request:
1. Slack message via your dedicated slack channel or Statsig Community support
2. Email via support@statsig.com
