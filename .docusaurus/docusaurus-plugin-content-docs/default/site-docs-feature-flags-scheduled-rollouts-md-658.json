  "description": "Feature Gates are powerful in ensuring a safe, controlled feature rollout. Scheduled Rollouts add a time-based scheduling layer to Feature Gates, enabling you to pre-set any rollout schedule you want, which will execute automatically. This is particularly useful if, for example, you have a feature launch happening in another timezone (and don’t want to stay up all night!) or you have a standard, company-wide ramp-up schedule you follow with every feature release.",
