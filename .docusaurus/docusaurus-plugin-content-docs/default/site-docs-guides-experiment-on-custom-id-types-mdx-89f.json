  "description": "In certain cases, you may want to randomize experiment bucketing using a custom Unit ID instead of the default userID or Statsig-generated Stable ID. For instance, if you're running a task management tool for companies and want to experiment on company-wide behaviors, you might use companyID as the Unit ID. This ensures all users from the same company get the same experience, allowing you to measure overall productivity impacts at a company level.",
