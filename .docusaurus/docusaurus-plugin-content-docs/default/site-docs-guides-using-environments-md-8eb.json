  "description": "Statsig SDKs allow you to set the environment tier for your app during initialization. This helps you evaluate feature gates, dynamic configs, and experiments differently in non-production environments like development or staging. All you need to do is configure the appropriate environment in your code and adjust feature rules in the Statsig Console.",
