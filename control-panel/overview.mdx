title: Control Panel
description: Track and manage features at scale
---

Control Panel is a surface to measure and track you and your teams' features that are deployed and measured with Statsig. This surface is similar to the standard gate/experiment tables in Statsig, and enables quickly tabbing between filters on top of the objects used to deploy and measure changes - configs, experiments, and gates - and quickly measure them, make or review ship decisions, and manage development flows like overrides.

## Using Control Panel

- Configure Sections in the left hand column. These specify different filters and display settings - e.g. "My Changes", or "My Team's Changes".
- View results inline. Configs and experiments have a summary of metric movements, which can be hovered to see a table of all observed metric movements. Gates and Dynamic Configs can be opened to see results per-rule.
- Manage configs. You can see or set your override status from control panel, and additionally killswitch features in case there's unexpected behaviors

## Beta
