# Alerts 
Statsig offers two types of alerts on the platform today:
1. **[Topline Metric Alerts](/product-analytics/alerts/topline_alerts)** - Monitor a metricâ€™s overall performance, independent of experiments or gates. These alerts keep you informed about topline trends and highlight when key product or business metrics move in a concerning direction.
2. **[Rollout Alerts](/product-analytics/alerts/rollout_alerts)** - Monitor how a metric behaves in the context of a feature gate or experiment rollout. These alerts help you confirm that no critical metrics regress when introducing a new change.

Topline Alerts are useful for keeping tabs on topline trends and ensuring you know if key product and business metrics are trending in a concerning direction. Rollout Alerts are helpful to confirm no key metrics are regressing when you start rolling out a new feature or experiment.  

<Info>
Topline Alerts are in a limited beta. Please reach out if you would like these enabled for your Project.
