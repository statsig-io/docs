description: "Statsig's long-lived Server SDKs, which are transitioning to the Server Core framework"
---

Statsig is in the process of transitioning to the new Statsig Server Core architecture, which unifies all Server SDKs around a unified, performance optimized core package. We expect this model will support both superior performance and greater feature consistency across SDKs. However, the vast majority of customers continue to use Statsig's legacy SDKs, and we'll continue to support them for the foreseeable future, with the exception of major feature additions.

## Timelines

We've begun announcing end-of-life for some Legacy Server SDKs. We encourage you to explore using the [Server Core SDKs](server-core/index), which often evaluate 5-10x faster than the legacy SDKs, are more feature complete, and have other performance advantages. See docs for our existing SDKs below:

- [Node](/server/nodejsServerSDK)
- [Python](/server/pythonSDK)
- [Elixir/Erlang](/server/erlangSDK) (End of Life April 30th, 2026)
- [Java](/server/javaSdk)
- [Rust](/server/rustSDK) (End of Life April 30th, 2026)
- [PHP](/server/php)
- [.NET](/server/dotnet)
