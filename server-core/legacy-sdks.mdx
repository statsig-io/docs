# Legacy Server SDKs

Statsig is in the process of transitioning to the new Statsig Server Core architecture, which unifies all Server SDKs around a unified, performance optimized core package. We expect this model will support both superior performance and greater feature consistency across SDKs.
However, the vast majority of customers continue to use Statsig's legacy SDKs, and we'll continue to support them for the foreseeable future, with the exception of major feature additions. 

## Timelines

No timelines have been established for the deprecation of legacy SDKs. We encourage you to explore using the Server Core SDKs, which often evaluate 5-10x faster than the legacy SDKs, are more feature complete, and have other performance advantages. See docs for our existing SDKs below:
* [Java](/server/javaSdk)
* [Python](/server/pythonSDK)
* [Node](/server/nodejsServerSDK)
* [Elixir/Erlang](/server/erlangSDK)
* [Rust](/server/rustSDK)
