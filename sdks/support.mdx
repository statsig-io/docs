title: SDK Support Policy
---

To ensure the security, performance, and reliability of our SDKs, we only provide official support for SDK versions that are less than **one year old** from their release date, unless otherwise specified (some updates may require a different timeline or migration path).

## Supported Versions

- We provide support (bug reports, issue investigation, and compatibility assistance) for SDK versions released **within the past 12 months**.
- Versions older than one year are considered **unsupported**. While they may continue to function, we do not guarantee their behavior or compatibility with our backend services.
- We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest version to benefit from new features, performance improvements, and critical fixes.

## Versioning and Releases

- All SDKs follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/), using the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, **unless otherwise specified**.
  - **MAJOR**: breaking changes
  - **MINOR**: backwards-compatible new features
  - **PATCH**: backwards-compatible bug fixes
- Release notes are published in the GitHub Releases section of each SDK’s repository. These notes contain details on changes, improvements, and upgrade instructions.

## Open Source and Community Contributions

- All SDKs are open source and licensed under the [ISC License](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC), allowing developers to freely use, modify, and distribute them.
- We welcome and encourage community contributions.

## Need Help?

For help with upgrading, reviewing release notes, or contributing, please refer to the SDK’s GitHub repository or reach out in [Slack](https://statsig.com/slack).
