Statsig's SDKs are the in-code tool you'll use to show experiment variants, flag your features, and log your key business metrics. Statsig's SDKs:
* **Abstract the complexity away:** we handle caching, retry mechanisms, networking, etc.
* **Encourage best practice:** built around parameters & language-specific best practice
* **Broad deployment support:** 30+ SDKs across clients, servers, the edge, and more.

## When Will I Use the Statsig SDKs?

### 1. **Targeting & Assignment**
Decide in-code who sees new features and experiment variants. Target based on any **user attributes** (e.g., location, device type) or **environment-level attributes**, letting you fine-tune rollouts and experiment enrollment.

### 2. **Logging Events**
Log your key business metrics to power experiment & product analytics. Your events are piped into Statsig without any extra effort. For web-based platforms (e.g., JavaScript, React), Statsig also supports **[Autocaptured Events](/webanalytics/overview)**.

## Choosing the Right SDK: Client vs. Server

Statsig offers both **client-side** and **server-side** SDKs, each suited to different use cases:

- **Client-Side SDKs**: Designed for user-facing applications where events are logged directly from the browser or mobile app. These SDKs work in real-time, providing instant feedback on user behavior.

- **Server-Side SDKs**: Ideal for backend services, allowing you to control experiments, feature flags, and log server-side events. Server-side SDKs offer more control, especially for use cases involving system-level actions or business logic.

For a detailed comparison, refer to the [Client vs Server SDK Overview](/sdks/client-vs-server).

Additionally, for frameworks like **Next.js** that bridge client and server-side logic, we offer guides like the [Next.js SDK](/client/Next) to help you integrate.

## Next Steps: Installing Your SDK

1. **Select Your SDK**: Choose the client or server SDK that fits your platform from the lists above.
2. **Follow the Installation Guide**: Each SDK has an installation guide that walks you through the setup, ensuring a smooth integration with your app.
3. **Start Experimenting**: Once integrated, you can begin setting up feature flags, running experiments, and logging events for analysis.
