title: Migration Overview
---

Statsig combines feature flags, experimentation, and product analytics in one platform. Migrating ensures your data, flag, experiments, and decision workflows live in a single source of truth.

This guide outlines the overall migration process. For provider-specific steps (Amplitude, LaunchDarkly, etc.), see our dedicated guides.

## Migration Phases

### 1. Audit & Plan

- Identify the datasets, events, and feature flags you want to move
- Decide what needs full historical backfill vs. what can start fresh
- Document any dashboards or KPIs that need rebuilding in Statsig

### 2. Set Up Live Data

- Implement Statsig SDKs to start streaming new events and feature flag evaluations
- Validate critical events are firing with the correct schema
- Use Statsig for the newly recorded events and flags

### 3. Import Historical Data

- Export data from your existing tool (S3 or warehouse is preferred)
- Transform the schema to Statsig's event format (`event`, `user`, `timestamp`, `metadata`)
- Import via Statsig's Event Webhook, S3 ingestion, or warehouse ingestion

### 4. Validate & Decommission

- Compare metrics between your legacy tool and Statsig to ensure parity
- Rebuild dashboards and charts in Statsig
- Decommission old pipelines once Statsig is your single source of truth

## Best Practices

- **Start small**: Run a pilot project or test migration before backfilling all history
- **Align IDs early**: Ensure `userID` and `stableID` mapping is consistent. Identity mismatches are the most common failure point
- **Shard historical imports**: Break large datasets into daily partitions for stability
- **Rebuild insights intentionally**: Don't port all events and flags directly. Use migration as a chance to clean up stale data
- **Plan change management**: Teams need time to adjust workflows, queries, and dashboards so migrate for 1-2 teams before championing in the broader org
