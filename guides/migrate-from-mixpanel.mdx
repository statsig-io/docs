# Mixpanel Migration Guide

Switching from Mixpanel to Statsig is a smart move for teams seeking a unified platform that combines analytics, experimentation, and feature flagging. This all-in-one approach empowers faster, more informed decisions without data silos.

Migrating Mixpanel data into Statsig usually involves three steps: export, transform, and ingest. This guide provides the essentials. For anything beyond these basics, please contact us.

**Note:** We will only cover importing raw events into Statsig. We don't support importing user/group profiles, dashboards, reports, etc. Once your raw events are in the Statsig project, you can re-create your critical dashboards here.

## Step 1. Export your data from Mixpanel

Mixpanel offers a few different export methods. Pick the one that matches your data size and setup:

**1. CSV Export**

Export small batches of events as CSV via the Events tab → query events → click "Export" button.

**2. Export API**

Use Mixpanel's [Raw Event Export API](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/raw-event-export) to pull JSONL data:
- **Limit**: Export one day's data at a time for optimal performance
- **Format**: JSONL where each line is a valid JSON object

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://data.mixpanel.com/api/2.0/export?from_date=2023-01-01&to_date=2023-01-01' \
-u '{project_id}:{service_account_secret}'
```

**3. Data Pipelines (Bulk Export)**

For large data volumes, use Mixpanel's [Data Pipelines](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-pipelines) feature to export to:
- Cloud Storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage)
- Data Warehouse (BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake)

## Step 2. Transform your data

Mixpanel and Statsig store events in slightly different formats. Map your Mixpanel data to Statsig's format:

| Mixpanel field | Statsig field |
|----------------|---------------|
| `event` | `event` |
| `properties.time` | `timestamp` (ms since epoch) |
| `properties.distinct_id` or `properties.user_id` | `user.userID` |
| `properties.device_id` | `user.stableID` |
| `properties.*` (other fields) | `metadata` |

**Before transform**

```json
// Mixpanel event
{
  "event": "Signed up",
  "properties": {
    "time": 1618716477,
    "distinct_id": "user-123",
    "device_id": "xyz",
    "Referred_by": "Friend",
    "URL": "website.com/signup"
  }
}
```

**After transform**

```json
// Statsig event
{
  "event": "Signed up",
  "user": {
    "userID": "user-123",
    "stableID": "xyz"
  },
  "timestamp": 1618716477000,
  "metadata": {
    "Referred_by": "Friend",
    "URL": "website.com/signup"
  }
}
```

## Step 3. Import into Statsig

Once your data looks like Statsig events, you can start bringing them in:

| If you exported from Mixpanel via... | Import into Statsig using... | Best when... |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|
| S3 export | [S3 ingestion](/data-warehouse-ingestion/s3) | You're backfilling large datasets |
| Warehouse (Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift) | [Warehouse ingestion](/data-warehouse-ingestion/introduction) | Your Mixpanel data already lives in a warehouse |
| Export API | [Event Webhook](https://docs.statsig.com/http-api#post-event-webhook) | You're moving a few days/weeks of data programmatically |
| CSV download | [Event Webhook](https://docs.statsig.com/http-api#post-event-webhook) | You're testing or moving a small slice of data |

**Event Webhook (for API/CSV exports)**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.statsig.com/v1/webhooks/event_webhook \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "STATSIG-API-KEY: $STATSIG_SERVER_SECRET" \
-d '{
  "event": "Signed up",
  "user": {
    "userID": "user-123",
    "stableID": "xyz"
  },
  "timestamp": 1618716477000,
  "metadata": {
    "Referred_by": "Friend",
    "URL": "website.com/signup"
  }
}'
```

**Important notes:**
- **S3 ingestion**: Shard your Mixpanel data into 1 day's data per directory for Statsig
- **Scale gradually**: After small tests, backfill in chunks to manage loads
- **Future tracking**: After historical import, switch Mixpanel code calls to Statsig SDKs
