We renamed the iOS/macOS/tvOS repo from `ios-sdk` to `statsig-kit`

### Motivation

The Statsig Swift SDK repo used to live on `statsig-io/ios-sdk`. Since Xcode uses the repository name as the package name, it would use `ios-sdk`.
This same repo name is used by other packages, like Spotify's, which caused a conflict for apps trying to import both SDKs.

Given that this issue was blocking some customers from using Statsig, we decided to rename the repo. Thank you to everyone that reported the issue.

## Migration Guide

### Apps using Xcode

> **Optional Migration**: The existing repo will continue working thanks to GitHub's redirect.

1. In Xcode, click on your project on the sidebar. That's usually the item on the root of the tree view.
2. Choose your project under the "Project" section of the second sidebar
3. Choose the "Package Dependencies" tab on the top
4. Find Statsig's SDK row
5. On the Location column, replace `https://github.com/statsig-io/ios-sdk.git` with `https://github.com/statsig-io/statsig-kit.git` 

### Packages using Package.swift

> **Required Migration**: GitHub's repo redirect doesn't work for packages using Package.swift

1. Open your Package.swift file
2. Replace `https://github.com/statsig-io/ios-sdk.git` with `https://github.com/statsig-io/statsig-kit.git`
3. Replace `ios-sdk` with `statsig-kit`
4. Build your project. If you get an error, build again at least once.
