## What IP addresses will Statsig access data warehouses from?

Statsig currently accesses data warehouses from both the Statsig console service and Statsig data pipelines. If your data warehouse is IP protected, please refer to the [Statsig IP range documentation](/infrastructure/statsig_ip_ranges) for IPs to allowlist, and notify us that your warehouse is IP protected on Slack.

## Does event data from ingestion count towards User Accounting Metrics?

No, event data from ingestions does not count towards Statsig's User Accounting Metrics such as DAU or Retention. Customers typically send Statsig a subset of their events, which could result in multiple competing values for "fact" data such as daily active users in your Statsig project. Statsig recommends sending your own precomputed metric for DAU or as a daily event per user (1 'daily_active' event if a user was active that day).

## How long does the data take to load?

For most customers, data ingestions should take 1-2 hours to materialize in the Statsig console after the ingestion is scheduled. Note that the schedule is in PST, and not PDT, so depending on daylight savings time ingestions may start an hour later or earlier.

## Does Statsig load data incrementally every day?

Statsig loads data incrementally every day. Statsig also monitors data over several follow-up windows for up to two weeks, and reloads data for a given day if it has changed more than 1%.

## Can I ingest multiple metrics in the same scheduled ingestion?

Yes, you can ingest multiple metrics (and event types) in the same scheduled ingestion. Statsig enables you to run a SQL query against your data warehouse cluster to join multiple tables to generate a view with all your precomputed metrics. You can use this as the source view for your scheduled data ingestion and import multiple metrics at the same time.

For example, your dataset could import both `metric-1` and `metric-2`, with `metric-2` including multiple units of analysis, say user_id and alphabet_id.

## How does missing metric values affect experiment calculations?

If the metric value is unavailable for a given user on a given day, Statsig takes it to be `zero` for additive metrics such as counts and sums. For metrics that depend on a user "participating" in the metric, say conversion rate, the user is excluded. Note that additive metrics typically have a single `metric_value` column in the ingested data, while ratio (participating) metrics typically have separate `numerator` and `denominator` columns.

## Does Statsig notify about ingestion status?

Statsig shows the status of your daily ingestion on the console under the **Ingestions** tab. Statsig reports three kinds of ingestion statuses:

- ingestion succeeded for a given day
- ingestion succeeded for a given day, but no data was detected
- ingestion failed for a given day

Statsig also sends email notifications with these status updates to the Statsig user who set up the ingestion. This user can also enable Slack direct message (DM) notifications to themselves in their Statsig [Account Settings](https://console.statsig.com/account_notifications).

## Does Statsig automatically backfill data?

Statsig looks back at data for 3 days from the initial ingestion to see data has changed (>5% increase in the number of rows) to automatically trigger a backfill. Outside of this window, we expect the customer to trigger backfill for the range of dates.
