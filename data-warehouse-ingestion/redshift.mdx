## Overview

To set up connection with Redshift, Statsig needs the following

- Cluster Endpoint
- Admin User Name
- Admin User Password

<Note>
SHA256 passwords are not currently supported, please utilize MD5 to avoid issues.
</Note> 

You can find this information in your aws console within your specific cluster, as shown in the image below. (Open image in new tab for a bigger image)

<b>Admin user name and password will be used by Statsig to create a user with restricted access to query from your data warehouse.</b>

## SSH Tunneling

For Redshift connections, we also allow users to create an SSH tunnel into their Redshift cluster for a more secure and private access to the database.
To enable access, Statsig requires:

- SSH Host
- SSH Port
- SSH User

Statsig will use this information to generate an SSH key. Please add this generated key to your `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on your SSH proxy machine to enable SSH tunneling.

### Custom User Privileges

To create a custom user with specific privileges instead of using an admin user, run the following code in your Redshift cluster with your admin user.
Replace `<USER>` and `<PASSWORD>` with your value, which you will copy over into our console.


```sql
# Create Statsig User
CREATE USER <USER> WITH PASSWORD <PASSWORD> SYSLOG ACCESS UNRESTRICTED;

# Give access to any Schemas that the Statsig User needs to read from
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <SCHEMA> to <USER>;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <SCHEMA> to <USER>;

# Create a Schema for Statsig User to write temporary data to
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS statsig_ingestion_staging;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA <SCHEMA> TO <USER>;
```

After running the script, input the `<USER>` and `<PASSWORD>` you created in our console, during Connection Set Up stage under the Advanced settings options.
