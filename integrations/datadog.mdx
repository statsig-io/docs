### Overview

There are four key use-cases to the Datadog integration:
1. [Config Changes](#config-changes) - Streaming changes made in Statsig into Datadog, so you can see what feature was turned on that may have caused a CPU usage spike or some other degradation of performance (most widely-used integration).
2. [Event Forwarding](#events) - Statsig will forward event-count totals to DataDog, purely for the purpose of monitoring your Statsig usage volumes. 
3. [Datadog RUM integration](#datadog-rum-integration) - This allows you to enrich DataDog RUM data with flag/experiment assignment info, allowing customer to correlate product feature changes with their impact on system/performance metrics.
4. [DataDog triggers](https://docs.statsig.com/integrations/triggers/datadog) - When an alarm goes off in DataDog, it kills a Statsig feature gate.

### Connecting to Datadog

1. To create a Datadog API key, navigate to **Organization Settings** > **API Keys**. If you have the permission to create API keys, click **New Key**.

2. Paste the API key in the text box at the top of the integration dialog, then hit "Confirm".

If the above is out of date, refer to the [Datadog documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/#add-an-api-key-or-client-token) on how to setup API Keys

### Config Changes

This integration will send Datadog Events of your choice when your
project&apos;s settings change. For instance, we will send an Event when
someone edits a Feature Gate.

These events can be found in the Datadog Events Explorer.

### Event Totals Forwarding

This integration will forward the <i>number</i> of Statsig SDK Events
reported to Datadog. This is meant for monitoring your project's Statsig
usage. This integration also has the option to allow non-production events
to be forwarded to Datadog.

Statsig events are mapped to Datadog metrics with listed tags as follows:

- statsig::gate_exposure -> statsig.check_gate.count

  - environment
  - name
  - value

- statsig::config_exposure -> statsig.get_config.count

  - environment

- statsig::experiment_exposure -> statsig.get_experiment.count

  - environment
  - group
  - name

- statsig::layer_exposure -> statsig.get_layer.count

  - environment
  - name

- statsig::holdout_exposure -> statsig.get_holdout.count
  - environment
  - name
  - value

### Datadog RUM integration
This integration requires a client-side setup as outlined [here in DataDog documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/statsig-rum/).
