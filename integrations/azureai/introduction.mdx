Statsig offers SDKs for integrating Azure AI models into server applications. These SDKs simplify the implementation of features like completions and embeddings in your server application. They provide easy-to-use APIs and automatically track metrics such as latency, token length, and model details, which you can use for optimization and experimentation. Use cases include:
* Implement Azure AI Models in your code with a [single lightweight framework](/azureai/model-client)
* [Stream completions](/azureai/completions) and [generate embeddings](/azureai/embeddings)
* [Capture invocation and usage metrics](/azureai/capturing-metrics/) with no extra work
* [Run A/B tests on parameters](/azureai/running-experiments) like model, prompt, temperature and more
