title: Event Filtering
---

Once you've enabled an integration, you can select specific events that you want to send and/or receive by clicking on the **Event Filtering** button.

The steps outline below are for the Segment integration, but the steps to enable **Event Filtering** are the same across integrations.

## Incoming Event Filtering

If your integration includes "Incoming" events, you can filter which ones Statsig should care about. All others will not be logged.

- Visit the [integrations](https://console.statsig.com/integrations) page on console.statsig.com.
- Select the integration you wish to filter events for.
- In the dialog that appears, select "Event Filtering"

- You can now search for specific events and select or deselect the events that you want Statsig to ingest.
