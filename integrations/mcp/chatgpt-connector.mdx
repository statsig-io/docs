## Overview

You can set up a ChatGPT App (built on top of the Statsig MCP server), allowing you to query experiments, manage feature flags, explore analytics -- all directly within OpenAI's ChatGPT conversational interface.

## Installation

1. Navigate to the Statsig App in the ChatGPT Apps Directory [here](https://chatgpt.com/apps/statsig/asdk_app_6967f065ac9481918969c660ff7686e9).
2. Click "Connect" and "Continue" to complete OAuth for your Statsig project.
   <Note>
     ChatGPT App OAuth only supports Personal Console API Keys. Ensure your
     Statsig org owner has enabled Personal Console API Keys creation for your
     role [here](https://console.statsig.com/settings?tab=organization){" "}

## Using Statsig MCP within ChatGPT

With Statsig MCP configured in ChatGPT, you can:

- **Explore Experiments**: "List all my active experiments"
- **Manage Gates**: "What gates are currently stale?"
- **Configure Dynamic Configs**: "Show me the configuration for the dynamic config 'dynamic-config'"
- **Get Insights**: "Show me details about the experiment called 'new-checkout-flow'"

## Next Steps

After installation, you can:

- List experiments, gates, and dynamic configs
- Create and update experiments, gates, and configs
- Access your Statsig data directly from Codex
