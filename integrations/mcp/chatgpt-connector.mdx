## Overview

You can set up a connector between the Statsig MCP server and ChatGPT, allowing you to query experiments, manage feature flags, explore analytics -- all directly within ChatGPT's conversational interface.

## Installation
1. Navigate to "Settings > Apps and Connectors > Advanced Settings" and turn on Developer mode.
(Note: Developer mode is currently only available for Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise / Edu tiers). 

2. Once Developer mode is activated, return to the Apps and Connectors settings pane, and in the "Enabled apps and connectors" section, select "Create an app".

3. Fill out the form to create a new ChatGPT app:
    * Add a name (e.g., Statsig MCP) for your tool
    * Under "MCP Server URL", fill in `https://api.statsig.com/v1/mcp`
    * Under "Authentication", select OAuth.
