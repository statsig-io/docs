## Installation

On Claude Code, we recommend using OAuth and the HTTP transport directly. Run this command on the command line:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http statsig https://api.statsig.com/v1/mcp
```

This command will:
- Add the Statsig MCP server to your Claude Code configuration
- Configure it to use HTTP transport with OAuth authentication
- Set up the connection to Statsig's MCP endpoint

<Accordion title="Using API key instead of OAuth">

While we recommend setting up Statsig MCP via OAuth, you can also authenticate with your Console API key. Run this command on the command line:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http statsig-local https://api.statsig.com/v1/mcp \
  --header "statsig-api-key: console-YOUR-CONSOLE-API-KEY"
```

Replace `console-YOUR-CONSOLE-API-KEY` with your actual Statsig Console API key, which you can retrieve [here](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys). Ensure your API key has the right permissions — read-only keys can view data, while write keys can make changes to your project!

## Authentication via OAuth
To authenticate via OAuth, run `/mcp` in Claude Code and follow the setup instructions:

1. Claude Code will open a browser window
2. Sign in to your Statsig account
3. Authorize the MCP server to access your Statsig project
4. The authentication will be saved for future sessions

## Verification

After installation, you can verify the connection by:

1. Opening Claude Code
2. Asking Claude to list your Statsig experiments or gates
3. If configured correctly, Claude will be able to access your Statsig data

## Using Statsig MCP with Claude Code

Once configured, you can interact with your Statsig data through Claude Code:

- **Query Experiments**: "What experiments are currently running?"
- **Manage Gates**: "List all my feature flags"
- **Get Details**: "Show me the configuration for gate 'new-feature'"
- **Create Entities**: "Create a new experiment called 'checkout-test'"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Make sure you have the latest version of Claude Code
- Verify your Statsig account has the necessary API permissions
- Check that the MCP server URL is correct: `https://api.statsig.com/v1/mcp`
- Try re-running the installation command
