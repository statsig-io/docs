description: Learn how to manually configure the Statsig MCP server for any MCP-compatible tool.
---

## Overview

If your tool doesn't have a specific setup guide, you can manually configure the Statsig MCP server. This guide covers the general configuration steps that work with any MCP-compatible client.

## Prerequisites

- A Statsig account (sign up at [console.statsig.com](https://console.statsig.com))
- An MCP-compatible tool or client
- Access to your tool's configuration files

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

Add the following configuration to your MCP client's configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "statsig": {
      "url": "https://api.statsig.com/v1/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication

Statsig MCP uses OAuth for authentication. When you first use the MCP server:

1. Your tool will prompt you to authenticate
2. You'll be redirected to Statsig's OAuth page
3. Sign in and authorize the MCP server
4. The authentication token will be stored automatically

## Verification

After adding the configuration:

1. Restart your tool to apply the changes
2. Check your tool's MCP server list to verify Statsig appears
3. Try using a Statsig MCP command to test the connection

## Testing the Connection

You can test the connection by asking your tool to:

- **List experiments**: "Get list of experiments"
- **List gates**: "Get list of gates"
- **Get details**: "Get details for experiment [experiment-id]"
