## Overview

If your AI tool supports MCP but isn't listed in our specific guides, you can use this generic configuration to connect to the Statsig MCP server.

## MCP Server Configuration

Add the following MCP server configuration JSON to your tool's config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "statsig": {
      "command": "npx mcp-remote https://api.statsig.com/v1/mcp --header statsig-api-key:${AUTH_TOKEN}",
      "env": {
        "AUTH_TOKEN": "console-YOUR-CONSOLE-API-KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `console-YOUR-CONSOLE-API-KEY` with your actual Statsig Console API key, which you can retrieve from [https://console.statsig.com/api_keys](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).

## API Key Permissions

Ensure your API key has the right permissions:
- **Read-only keys** can view experiments, gates, and configs
- **Write keys** can make changes to your project

## Alternative: Direct URL Configuration

Some tools support direct URL-based MCP configuration. In that case, use:

```
https://api.statsig.com/v1/mcp
```

With the header:
```
statsig-api-key: console-YOUR-CONSOLE-API-KEY
```

## Verification

After configuration, verify the connection by asking your AI tool to:
- List your Statsig experiments
- Show your feature gates
- Display a specific dynamic config

If the tool can access your Statsig data, the setup is complete.
