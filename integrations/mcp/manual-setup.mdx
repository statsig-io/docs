title: Statsig MCP with Other MCP-Compatible Clients
description: Learn how to manually configure the Statsig MCP server for any MCP-compatible tool.
---

## Overview

If your tool doesn't have a specific setup guide, you can manually configure the Statsig MCP server. This guide covers the general configuration steps that work with any MCP-compatible client.

## Prerequisites

- A Statsig account (sign up at [console.statsig.com](https://console.statsig.com))
- An MCP-compatible tool or client
- Access to your tool's configuration files

## Configuration

Add the following configuration to your MCP client's configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "statsig": {
      "url": "https://api.statsig.com/v1/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

This installs the Statsig MCP Server with OAuth. When you first use the MCP server:

1. Your tool will prompt you to authenticate
2. You'll be redirected to Statsig's OAuth page
3. Sign in and authorize the MCP server
4. The authentication token will be stored automatically

<Note>
  MCP OAuth only supports Personal Console API Keys. Ensure your Statsig org
  owner has enabled Personal Console API Keys creation for your role
  [here](https://console.statsig.com/settings?tab=organization){" "}
</Note>

<Accordion title="Using API Key instead of OAuth">
While we recommend setting up Statsig MCP via OAuth, you can also authenticate with your Console API key. Add the below configuration to your MCP client's configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "statsig": {
      "command": "npx mcp-remote https://api.statsig.com/v1/mcp --header statsig-api-key:${AUTH_TOKEN}",
      "env": {
        "AUTH_TOKEN": "console-YOUR-CONSOLE-API-KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `console-YOUR-CONSOLE-API-KEY` with your actual Statsig Console API key, which you can retrieve [here](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys). Ensure your API key has the right permissions — read-only keys can view data, while write keys can make changes to your project!

</Accordion>

## Verification

After adding the configuration:

1. Restart your tool to apply the changes
2. Check your tool's MCP server list to verify Statsig appears
3. Try using a Statsig MCP command to test the connection

## Testing the Connection

You can test the connection by asking your tool to:

- **List experiments**: "Get list of experiments"
- **List gates**: "Get list of gates"
- **Get details**: "Get details for experiment [experiment-id]"
