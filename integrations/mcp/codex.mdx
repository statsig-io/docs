title: Statsig MCP with Codex
description: Learn how to set up the Statsig MCP server using Codex CLI, IDE extension, or Codex Cloud.
---

## Overview

You can set up the Statsig MCP server on Codex CLI and Codex IDE Extension today.
Codex CLI is an pre-requisite to set up MCP for the Codex IDE extension or Codex Cloud. You can install Codex CLI based on the [instructions here](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/).

## Authentication
Once Codex CLI is set up, navigate to `~/.codex/config.toml` and add the below: 

```bash
[mcp_servers.statsig]
url = https://api.statsig.com/v1/mcp
trust_level = "trusted"

[features]
rmcp_client = true
```

You'll need to sign in to your Statsig account and authorize the MCP server to access your Statsig project. Once configured, you should see the Statsig MCP server listed as active in the Codex extension's MCP servers panel.

## Using Statsig MCP with Codex

With Statsig MCP configured in any Codex environment, you can:

- **Explore Experiments**: "List all my active experiments"
- **Manage Gates**: "What gates are currently stale?"
- **Configure Dynamic Configs**: "Show me the configuration for the dynamic config 'dynamic-config'"
- **Get Insights**: "Show me details about the experiment called 'new-checkout-flow'"

## Next Steps

After installation, you can:
- List experiments, gates, and dynamic configs
- Create and update experiments, gates, and configs
- Access your Statsig data directly from Codex
