title: Statsig MCP with Codex
description: Learn how to set up the Statsig MCP server using Codex CLI, IDE extension, or Codex Cloud.
---

## Overview

Codex offers multiple ways to set up the Statsig MCP server:
- **Codex CLI**: Command-line interface for quick setup
- **Codex IDE Extension**: Visual interface in your IDE
- **Codex Cloud**: Web-based setup in Codex Cloud

Choose the method that best fits your workflow.

## Codex CLI

Install the Statsig MCP server using the Codex CLI:

```bash
codex mcp add statsig -- url https://api.statsig.com/v1/mcp 
```

This command will automatically update your `~/.codex/config.toml` file with the Statsig MCP server configuration.


## Codex IDE Extension

The Codex IDE extension provides a visual interface for managing MCP servers, including Statsig.

1. Open the Codex extension settings
2. Navigate to MCP Servers
3. Click "Add Server" or "New Server"
4. Enter the following configuration:
   - **Name**: `statsig`
   - **URL**: `https://api.statsig.com/v1/mcp`
   - **Authentication**: OAuth (automatic)

The extension will guide you through the OAuth authentication process. You'll need to sign in to your Statsig account and authorize the MCP server to access your Statsig project

Once configured, you should see the Statsig MCP server listed as active in the Codex extension's MCP servers panel.

## Codex Cloud

1. In Codex Cloud, navigate to your project settings and add the Statsig MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "statsig": {
      "url": "https://api.statsig.com/v1/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

2. Codex Cloud will prompt you to authenticate with Statsig using OAuth. Follow the authentication flow to grant access to your Statsig project.

## Using Statsig MCP with Codex

With Statsig MCP configured in any Codex environment, you can:

- **Explore Experiments**: "List all my active experiments"
- **Manage Gates**: "What gates are currently stale?"
- **Configure Dynamic Configs**: "Show me the configuration for the dynamic config 'dynamic-config'"
- **Get Insights**: "Show me details about the experiment called 'new-checkout-flow'"

## Next Steps

After installation, you can:
- List experiments, gates, and dynamic configs
- Create and update experiments, gates, and configs
- Access your Statsig data directly from Codex
