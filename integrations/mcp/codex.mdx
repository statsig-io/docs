title: Statsig MCP with Codex
description: Learn how to set up the Statsig MCP server using Codex CLI or IDE extension.
---

## Overview

You can set up the Statsig MCP server using an API key on Codex CLI and Codex IDE Extension today.

## Installation
To setup Statsig MCP with Codex, add the below to your `~/.codex/config.toml` file:

```toml
[mcp_servers.statsig]
command = "npx"
args = ["--yes", "mcp-remote", "https://api.statsig.com/v1/mcp", "--header", "statsig-api-key: console-YOUR-CONSOLE-API-KEY"]
trust_level = "trusted"
```

Replace `console-YOUR-CONSOLE-API-KEY` with your actual Statsig Console API key, which you can retrieve [here](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys). Ensure your API key has the right permissions — read-only keys can view data, while write keys can make changes to your project!


## Using Statsig MCP with Codex

With Statsig MCP configured in any Codex environment, you can:

- **Explore Experiments**: "List all my active experiments"
- **Manage Gates**: "What gates are currently stale?"
- **Configure Dynamic Configs**: "Show me the configuration for the dynamic config 'dynamic-config'"
- **Get Insights**: "Show me details about the experiment called 'new-checkout-flow'"

## Next Steps

After installation, you can:
- List experiments, gates, and dynamic configs
- Create and update experiments, gates, and configs
- Access your Statsig data directly from Codex
