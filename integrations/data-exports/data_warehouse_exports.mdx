title: Data Warehouse Exports
---

## Introduction

You can export your data from Statsig to your Data Warehouse with a Data Connection. This lets you send exposures and events directly to your warehouse for further analysis. We currently support connections to the following providers: 

1. Snowflake
2. Redshift
3. S3
4. BigQuery
5. Databricks

<Info>
Data Warehouse Exports are an Enterprise-only feature. If you are on the Developer or Pro tiers and wish to upgrade to Enterprise, feel free to reach out to our team [here](https://www.statsig.com/contact/demo) or via support.

## How to Begin

1. Go to Statsig Console

3. Go to “Exports List”

On the Exports page, you will find an Export History tab and a Schedule Export tab. The Export History tab shows you a list of all previous experimentation exports triggered from the Experiment Results page. To understand how to export one-off experimentation results, check out the documentation [here](/integrations/data-exports/experiment_result_exports). 

Under the Scheduled Export tab, you will be prompted to set up a data warehouse connection. You will be required to set up connections with necessary credentials and grant Statsig Read, Write, and Delete permissions. Check out the [Connection Set Up](/data-warehouse-ingestion/snowflake) page for more information.

## Table Schema
Statsig will allow you to export both Exposures and Events to your warehouse. During the set up process, we will prompt you to set up a table with the following schema:
### Exposures

## Troubleshooting Exports

If you set up an Export flow in Statsig, Statsig can notify you if your data connection is failing. To enable notifications, go to Settings → My Account → Email Notifications → Edit and click Alerts to subscribe to these notifications.

If your Exports are failing, make sure your warehouse is connected with up-to-date credentials and the necessary Read, Write, and Delete permissions.
