Events Mode brings the searching and filtering abilities from [Log Explorer](/infra-analytics/logs-explorer) to your _existing_ Statsig events data. No additional instrumentation required! 

- Debug user activity with more control
- Trace the sequence of actions a user performed
- Narrow in on specific events from metadata properties

<Info>
Events Mode is available to all **Statsig Cloud customers**.

### To Get Started:

1. Open Logs Explorer from the left navigation.
2. Use the toggle next to the search bar to switch from **Logs** mode to **Events** mode.
3. Start searching across event names, properties, and time ranges.

### How to Construct your Search
You can search through events in two ways:
1. **Writing queries:** Use [syntax-based search](/infra-analytics/logs-explorer-queries) to target specific events and properties
2. **Using the query builder:** Point-and-click to construct filters without syntax overhead.
