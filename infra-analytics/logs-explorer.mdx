Logs Explorer lets you query logs, traces, and ingested events from a single interface. Use it the same way whether you’re debugging infrastructure issues or investigating product event streams.

- **Search**: Slice logs down to only what's relevant (by service, host, status code, etc.)
- **Group**: Aggregate logs by dimensions like region, status, or browser.
- **Visualize**: Plot log groupings over time to spot spikes, regressions, or anomalies instantly.

### Searching in Logs Explorer
- **Write custom queries**: Check out our [syntax guide](/infra-analytics/logs-explorer-queries) to craft your search
- **Using the query builder**: Point-and-click to construct filters without syntax overhead.

### Getting Started with Log Explorer
To get started with Log Explorer, follow the [OTEL onboarding guide](/infra-analytics/getting-started.mdx) to set up log ingestion. Once that's ready, you can navigate from **Infra Analytics → Log Explorer** from the Statsig left menu.

You can also use Logs Explorer in [Events Mode](/infra-analytics/events-mode-logs-explorer) to search and analyze your existing Statsig Events — no additional instrumentation needed.
