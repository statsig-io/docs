**[Infra Analytics](https://statsig.com/infra-analytics)** pulls in logs, metrics, and alerts so you get system-level observability in the same place you analyze product outcomes.

- Collect metrics and traces through OpenTelemetry (OTEL)
- Search and analyze logs to investigate issues
- Create alerts tied to service health
- Connect infrastructure signals to product analytics for a unified understanding of impact

## Feature Highlights

- **Logs Explorer**: Debug incidents with search, filters, and visualizations
- **Topline Alerts**: Catch regressions and anomalies with log/metric-based triggers
- **Metrics Explorer**: Inspect infrastructure metrics alongside product metrics
