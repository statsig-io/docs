To use the SDK, add the following to your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
{:statsig_elixir, "~> 0.8.0"},
```

SDK is written using `rustler_precompiled`, which will download precompiled binary by default. But there is also an option to build Rust code within your project by cloning [statsig-server-core](https://github.com/statsig-io/statsig-server-core)

```bash
cd statsig-server-core/statsig-elixir/ 
# set the environment variable 
FORCE_STATSIG_NATIVE_BUILD="true" mix compile
```
