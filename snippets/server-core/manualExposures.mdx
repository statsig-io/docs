## Manual Exposures

By default, the SDK will automatically log an exposure event when you check a gate, get a config, get an experiment, or get a layer. However, there are times when you may want to log an exposure event manually. For example, if you're using a gate to control access to a feature, but you don't want to log an exposure until the user actually uses the feature, you can use manual exposures.
