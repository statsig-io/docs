After installation, you will need to initialize the SDK using a [Server Secret Key from the Statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).

<Warning>
Server Secret Keys should always be kept private. If you expose one, you can disable and recreate it in the Statsig console.
</Warning>

There is also an optional parameter named `options` that allows you to pass in a StatsigOptions to customize the SDK.
