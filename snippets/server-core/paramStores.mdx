### Parameter Stores

Sometimes you don't know whether you want a value to be a Feature Gate, Experiment, or Dynamic Config yet. If you want on-the-fly control of that outside of your deployment cycle, you can use Parameter Stores to define a parameter that can be changed into at any point in the Statsig console. Parameter Stores are optional, but parameterizing your application can prove very useful for future flexibility and can even allow non-technical Statsig users to turn parameters into experiments.
