## Statsig User

The `StatsigUser` object represents a user in Statsig. You must provide a `userID` or at least one of the `customIDs` to identify the user.

When calling APIs that require a user, you should pass as much information as possible in order to take advantage of advanced gate and config conditions (like country or OS/browser level checks), and correctly measure impact of your experiments on your metrics/events. At least one ID (userID or customID) is required because it's needed to provide a consistent experience for a given user (click here)

Besides userID, we also have email, ip, userAgent, country, locale and appVersion as top-level fields on StatsigUser. In addition, you can pass any key-value pairs in an object/dictionary to the custom field and be able to create targeting based on them.

### Private Attributes

Private attributes are user attributes that are used for evaluation but are not forwarded to any integrations. They are useful for PII or sensitive data that you don't want to send to third-party services.
