## Server Core

Statsig Server Core is a performance-focused rewrite of our server SDKs with a shared, core Rust library. With extensive optimization and Rust's inherent speed, Core SDKs can evaluate **5-10x** as fast as our native SDKs.

Server Core also introduces new features, like Parameter Stores, the SDK Observability Interface, and streaming flag/experiment changes (from the Statsig Forward Proxy)

Server Core is currently available for Java, Node, Elixir, Rust and Python. Need another language, or run into any issues? Let us know in the [Statsig Slack](https://statsig.com/slack) and we'll prioritize it.
