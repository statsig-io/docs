## Recommended Migration Path

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the new Dependencies">
    - Add the new SDK package/module and any required platform-specific dependencies for your environment.
    - Update import or require statements to reference the new SDK namespace or module.
    - For now - keep the old package in-place, it can be helpful to have both running in parallel momentarily during local testing for your upgrade. If needed (language dependent), you may want to alias the new package.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Initialization">
    - Switch to the new initialization syntax. New SDK keys aren't needed - if you choose to update them, ensure they have the same target apps.
    - If needed, use the appropriate builder or configuration pattern for setting options, and ensure you migrate the StatsigOptions you use, as some were renamed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update User Creation">
    - Migrate to the new format for creating user objects.
    - If needed, use the builder pattern or updated constructor to set user properties.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Method Calls">
    - Starting with a few calls, switch your config checks from the new to old SDK, replacing oldStatsig.getExperiment() with newStatsig.getExperiment()
    - As you change the package usage, conduct some testing of your service locally or with existing test patterns, to build confidence in the new SDK's operation.
    - As you migrate additional calls, update method names if they've changed (notably, get_config() to get_dynamic_config)
    - Once comfortable with the operation of the new SDK from call-by-call migration, consider the use of refactoring tools to migrate the bulk of your remaining calls.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Thoroughly">
    - Verify that all of your configs are successfully migrated - run your test suites end-to-end.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove old SDK">
    - Remove references to the old SDK, and clean up old initialization and import logic.
  </Step>
</Steps>
