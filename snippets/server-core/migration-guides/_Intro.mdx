## Why Migrate?

- **Performance**: {sdkType} Core evaluates faster than the legacy SDK
- **New Features**: Access to Parameter Stores, CMAB (Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits), observabilityClient, and more
- **Future Support**: All new features and improvements will only be available in {sdkType} Core
- **Maintenance**: The legacy {sdkType} SDK is in maintenance mode and will only receive critical bug fixes
