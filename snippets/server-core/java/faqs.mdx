<Accordion title="Should I use the uber JAR or platform-specific JARs?">
The uber JAR is recommended for most use cases as it includes native libraries for all popular platforms and simplifies deployment. Use platform-specific JARs only if you need to minimize JAR size or have specific dependency requirements.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I use this with Alpine Linux?">
For Alpine Linux (musl-based systems), install compatibility packages:
```dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache libgcc gcompat
```
The SDK will automatically use musl-compatible native libraries.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I handle initialization in production?">
The SDK initialization is asynchronous. Use `.get()` on the CompletableFuture to wait for initialization:
```java
Statsig statsig = new Statsig("secret-key", options);
statsig.initialize().get(); // Blocks until initialized
```
Always call `shutdown()` when your application terminates to flush pending events.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use multiple Statsig instances?">
Yes, you can create multiple Statsig instances with different configurations. You can also use the global singleton with `Statsig.getGlobalSingleton()` for convenience.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I debug SDK issues?">
Set the output logger level to DEBUG to see detailed logs:
```java
StatsigOptions options = new StatsigOptions.Builder()
    .setOutputLoggerLevel(OutputLogger.LogLevel.DEBUG)
    .build();
```
