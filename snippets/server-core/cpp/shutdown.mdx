```cpp
statsig.shutdownBlocking();
```

The `shutdown()` method will:
- Flush any pending events to Statsig servers
- Gracefully shutdown the SDK, cleaning up resources
- Wait for all operations to complete

It's recommended to call `shutdown()` before your application exits to ensure all events are sent.
