```cpp
FeatureGate gate = statsig.getFeatureGate(user, "example_gate");
std::cout << gate.rule_id << std::endl;
std::cout << gate.value << std::endl;
```

The `get_feature_gate()` method returns a FeatureGate object that provides:
- `value`: The boolean gate value
- `rule_id`: The ID of the rule that served this gate
- `id_type`: The type of the evaluation
- `evaluation_details`: Additional metadata about the evaluation
