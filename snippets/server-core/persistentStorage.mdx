## Persistent Storage

The Persistent Storage interface allows you to implement custom storage for user-specific configurations. This enables you to persist user assignments across sessions, ensuring consistent experiment groups even when the user returns later. This is particularly useful for client-side A/B testing where you want to ensure users always see the same variant.
