## Notes on Beta Version

The PHP SDK expects an adapter to be provided for both logging and saving config specs, given the stateless nature of PHP. In [our example](https://github.com/daniel-statsig/statsig-php-core-slim-example), we've provided simple file-based adapters. More mature implementations may choose a different, and more performant caching approach. If you need help setting this up, reach out to us in [Slack](https://statsig.com/slack).
