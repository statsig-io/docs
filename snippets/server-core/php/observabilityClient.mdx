The Observability Client interface allows you to monitor the health of the SDK by integrating with your own observability systems. This enables tracking metrics, errors, and performance data. For more information on the metrics emitted by Statsig SDKs, see the [Monitoring](/infrastructure/monitoring) documentation.
