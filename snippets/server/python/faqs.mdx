## FAQs

### How can I mock Statsig for testing?

The python server SDK, starting in version 0.5.1+, supports a few features to make testing easier.

First, there is a `StatsigOption` parameter called `localMode`. Setting `localMode` to true will cause the SDK to never hit the network, and only return default values. This is perfect for dummy environments or test environments that should not access the network.

Next, there are the `overrideGate` and `overrideConfig` APIs on the global `statsig` interface, see [Local Overrides](#local-overrides)

These can be used to set a gate or config override for a specific user, or for all users (by not providing a specific user ID).

We suggest you enable `localMode` and then override gates/configs/experiments to specific values to test the various code flows you are building.

### Can I generate the initialize response for a client SDK using the Python server SDK?

Yes. See [Client Initialize Response](#bootstrap).
