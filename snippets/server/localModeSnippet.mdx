Pass true to this option to turn on Local Mode for the SDK, which will stop the SDK from issuing any network requests and make it only operate with local overrides (if supported) and cache.

<Note>
Since no network requests will be made, a dummy SDK key can be used (e.g., `client-key` for client SDKs or `secret-key` for server SDKs).
