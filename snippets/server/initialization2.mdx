`initialize` will perform a network request. After `initialize` completes, virtually all SDK operations will be synchronous (See [Evaluating Feature Gates in the Statsig SDK](https://blog.statsig.com/evaluating-feature-gates-in-the-statsig-sdk-a6f8881a1ad8)). The SDK will fetch updates from Statsig in the background, independently of your API calls.
