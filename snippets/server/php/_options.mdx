<ResponseField name="IDataAdapter" type="IDataAdapter" required>
  A class that implements IDataAdapter. Statsig provides the LocalFileDataAdapter, but you can write your own. See [Data Stores](/server/concepts/data_store).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="ILoggingAdapter" type="ILoggingAdapter">
  A class that implements ILoggingAdapter. Statsig provides the LocalFileLoggingAdapter, but you can write your own. If no adapter is provided, logs will be sent during the request.
</ResponseField>
