There is also a parameter `options` that requires you to pass in a storage adapter for storing configurations and event logs. In this below example, we use a local file storage adapter, but you can write your own to plug in Redis or another storage solution.

You should create an adapter that implements `Statsig\Adapters\IConfigAdapter` that hooks up to your caching solution. By default, we provide a local file solution that can be useful for first time setup but is challenging to work with in production settings.

For help with the interface and implementing an adapter, browse the [adapters directory](https://github.com/statsig-io/php-sdk/tree/main/src/Adapters) in the open source SDK repository.

```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php'; // path to installation folder

use Statsig\StatsigServer;
use Statsig\StatsigOptions;
use Statsig\Adapters\LocalFileDataAdapter;
use Statsig\Adapters\LocalFileLoggingAdapter;

$config_adapter = new LocalFileDataAdapter();
$logging_adapter = new LocalFileLoggingAdapter();
$options = new StatsigOptions($config_adapter, $logging_adapter);
$this->statsig = new StatsigServer("server-sdk-key", $options);
```

### ðŸ”¥ Warning - You need to schedule a job ðŸ”¥

<Warning>
#### V3.0+
If you do not configure a job to update the config values, SDK does not fire a network request to fetch the latest config value anymore, instead, config values fetched earlier will be used.
