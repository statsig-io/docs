#### How can I mock Statsig for testing?

First, there is a `StatsigOptions` parameter called `localMode`.
Setting `localMode` to true will cause the SDK to never hit the network,
and only return default values. This is perfect for dummy environments or
test environments that should not access the network.

Next, there are the `overrideGate` and `overrideConfig` APIs on the global `Statsig` interface, see [Local Overrides](#local-overrides).

These can be used to set a gate or config value to be be returned for the given name.

We suggest you enable `localMode` and then override gates/configs to specific values to test the various code flows you are building.

You can view [LocalOverridesTest](https://github.com/statsig-io/java-server-sdk/blob/main/src/test/java/com/statsig/sdk/LocalOverridesTest.kt) to see overrides being used in test.

#### How can I bootstrap an on-device evaluation sdk?

If you are using a client on-device evaluation SDK, it consumes the same payload as Statsig server SDKs to do local evaluation.

The Java Server SDK [v1.31.0+](https://github.com/statsig-io/java-server-sdk/releases/tag/1.31.0) exposes this payload via:

```
getOnDeviceEvalInitializeResponse(clientSDKKey: String? = null): Map<String, Any>
```

The method returns a map which is the JSON payload that a client SDK will need to initialize synchronously.

You can use the `clientSDKKey` parameter to get the initialize response for a specific client key.  This enables you to use [Target Apps](/sdk-keys/target-apps) to filter down the list of gates/configs/experiments/layers accessible by that client key.  If not specified, the entire payload the server is operating with will be returned.

You can then use the synchronous initialization method on the client SDK to initialize with this payload.
