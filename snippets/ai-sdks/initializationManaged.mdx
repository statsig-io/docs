If you do not currently have an existing Statsig instance, you can initialize the AI SDKs by passing in the `sdkKey` and any `statsigOptions` you would like to apply.
This way of initializing the AI SDKs is recommended if you do not currently or want to actively manage your Statsig instance, in this case, statsigAI's lifecycle methods will be responsible for initializing, flushing, and shutting down the Statsig instance.
