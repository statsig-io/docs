### OpenTelemetry (OTEL)

The AI SDK works with OpenTelemetry for sending telemetry to Statsig.
You can enable OTel tracing by calling the `initializeTracing` function.
You can also provide a custom `TracerProvider` to the `initializeTracing` function if you want to customize the tracing behavior.
More advanced OTel configuration and exporter support are on the way.
