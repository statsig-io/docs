After installation, initialize the SDK with a [Server Secret Key from the Statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).

<Warning>
  Server Secret Keys should always be kept private. If you expose one, you can
  disable and recreate it in the Statsig console.
</Warning>

*You can import everything available in the Node Server Core SDK directly from the AI SDK — no separate setup needed.*

If you already manage your own Statsig instance, pass it into the AI SDK. 
In this case, the AI SDK won’t handle initialization, flushing, or shutdown.
