After installation, initialize the SDK with a [Server Secret Key from the Statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).

<Warning>
  Server Secret Keys should always be kept private. If you expose one, you can
  disable and recreate it in the Statsig console.
</Warning>

If you initialize this way, the AI SDK wonâ€™t handle initialization, flushing, or shutdown.
