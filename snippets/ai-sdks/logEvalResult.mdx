### Logging Eval Results

If you're running an [online eval](/ai-evals/online-evals), you'll need to log the results of the eval to Statsig for analysis. You should pass a score between 0 and 1, plus the grader you're using and any other user attributes that might be helpful for debugging or analysis. Today, we ask you to provide the grader, but in the future we'll provide grading options.
