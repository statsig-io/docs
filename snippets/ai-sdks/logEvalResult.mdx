### Logging Eval Results

When running an [online eval](/ai-evals/online-evals), you can log results back to Statsig for analysis.
Provide a score between 0 and 1, along with the grader name and any useful metadata (e.g., session IDs).
Currently, you must provide the grader manually â€” future releases will support automated grading options.
