### Programmatic Evaluation

Programmatic evaluation allows you to run evaluations on datasets programmatically, automatically scoring outputs and sending results to Statsig for analysis.

With programmatic evaluation, you can:

- **Run evaluations on datasets**: Process arrays, iterators, or async generators of input/expected pairs
- **Define custom tasks**: Create functions that generate outputs from inputs (supports both sync and async)
- **Score outputs**: Use single or multiple named scorer functions to evaluate outputs (supports boolean, numeric, or metadata-rich scores)
- **Use parameters**: Pass dynamic parameters to tasks using Zod schemas (Node) or dictionaries (Python)
- **Categorize data**: Group evaluation records by categories for better analysis
- **Compute summary scores**: Aggregate results across all records with custom summary functions
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Task and scorer errors are caught and reported without stopping the evaluation

The evaluation automatically sends results to Statsig, where you can view them in the console alongside your other eval data.
