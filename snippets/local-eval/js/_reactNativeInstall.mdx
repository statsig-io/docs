## Installation

<Note>
Since the `@statsig/react-native-bindings-on-device-eval` works in conjunction with `@statsig/js-on-device-eval-client`, documentation on those packages is also relevant for React Native implementations.
</Note>

Statsig uses a multi-package strategy, so you will need to install both the Statsig client and the React Native specific bindings.

```shell npm
npm install @statsig/react-native-bindings-on-device-eval
