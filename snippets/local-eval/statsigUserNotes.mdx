      <Note>
        For the {sdkName} On-Device Evaluation SDK, you pass the `StatsigUser` object {sdkName === "JavaScript" ? "into" : "directly into"} each evaluation method (`checkGate`, `getConfig`, etc.) rather than during initialization.
      </Note>
    )}
    
    <Note>
      Unlike precomputed evaluation SDKs, the on-device evaluation SDK does not have an `updateUser` method since it evaluates gates/configs/experiments in real-time for any user object you pass in.
