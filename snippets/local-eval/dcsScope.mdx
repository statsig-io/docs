<Warning>
For On-Device Evaluation, you'll need to add the **"Allow Download Config Specs"** scope. Client keys, by default, are not able to download the project definition for on-device evaluation.

While client keys are safe to include, Server and Console keys should always be kept private.
</Warning>
