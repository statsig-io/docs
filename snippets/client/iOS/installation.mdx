To use the SDK in your project, you must add Statsig as a dependency.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Swift Package Manager">
In your Xcode, select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency
and enter the URL https://github.com/statsig-io/statsig-kit.git.

You can also include it directly in your project's Package.swift. Find out the latest release version on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/statsig-io/statsig-kit/releases).

```swift
//...
dependencies: [
    // see the latest version on https://github.com/statsig-io/statsig-kit/releases
    .package(url: "https://github.com/statsig-io/statsig-kit.git", .upToNextMinor("X.Y.Z")),
],
//...
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YOUR_TARGET",
        dependencies: ["Statsig"]
    )
],
//...
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Cocoapods">
If you are using CocoaPods, our pod name is 'Statsig', and you can include the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
use_frameworks!
target 'TargetName' do
  //...
  pod 'Statsig', '~> X.Y.Z'
end
```

Find the latest versions by searching [cocoapods.org](https://cocoapods.org/) or on [Github](https://github.com/statsig-io/statsig-kit/releases).
