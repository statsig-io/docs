## Statsig User

You need to provide a StatsigUser object to check/get your configurations. You should pass as much 
information as possible in order to take advantage of advanced gate and config conditions.

Most of the time, the `userID` field is needed in order to provide a consistent experience for a given 
user (see [logged-out experiments](/guides/first-device-level-experiment) to understand how to correctly run experiments for logged-out 
users). 

Besides `userID`, we also have `email`, `ip`, `userAgent`, `country`, `locale` and `appVersion` as top-level fields on 
StatsigUser. In addition, you can pass any key-value pairs in an object/dictionary to the `custom` field and be able to 
create targeting based on them.

Once the user logs in or has an update/changed, make sure to call `updateUserWithResult`
with the updated `userID` and/or any other updated user attributes:

<CodeGroup>
```swift Swift
let user = StatsigUser(
  userID: "a-user-id",
  email: "user@example.com",
  ip: "192.168.1.1",
  userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0",
  country: "US",
  locale: "en_US",
  appVersion: "1.0.0",
  custom: [
    "plan": "premium",
    "age": 25
  ],
  customIDs: [
    "stableID": "stable-id-123"
  ],
  privateAttributes: [
    "email": "private@example.com"
  ]
)
```

```objective-c Objective C
StatsigUser *user = [[StatsigUser alloc] initWithUserID:@"a-user-id"];
user.email = @"user@example.com";
user.ip = @"192.168.1.1";
user.userAgent = @"Mozilla/5.0";
user.country = @"US";
user.locale = @"en_US";
user.appVersion = @"1.0.0";
user.custom = @{ @"plan": @"premium", @"age": @25 };
user.customIDs = @{ @"stableID": @"stable-id-123" };
user.privateAttributes = @{ @"email": @"private@example.com" };
```
