## StableID

Each client SDK has the notion of stableID, a devive-level identifier that is generated the first time the SDK is initialized and is stored locally for all future sessions. Unless storage is wiped (or app deleted), the stableID will not change.
This allows us to run device level experiments and experiments when other user identifiable information is unavailable (Logged out users).
