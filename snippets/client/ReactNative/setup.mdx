## React Native + React Specific Setup

The setup for a ReactNative environment is very similar to a plain [React environment](/client/React).
The only difference is that you need to use the ReactNative specific `StatsigProviderRN`.
This automatically switches out the storage layer used by the SDK, utilizing [AsyncStorage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage) instead of LocalStorage (which isn't available in RN environments).

```tsx
import {
  StatsigProviderRN,
  useFeatureGate,
} from "@statsig/react-native-bindings";

function Content() {
  const gate = useFeatureGate("a_gate");

  // Reason: Network or NetworkNotModified
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Value: {gate.value ? "Pass" : "Fail"}</Text>
      <Text>Reason: {gate.details.reason}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <StatsigProviderRN
      sdkKey={YOUR_CLIENT_KEY}
      user={{ userID: "a-user" }}
      loadingComponent={<Text>Loading...</Text>}
    >
      <Content />
    </StatsigProviderRN>
  );
}
```

**Avoid iOS 18.4 on Simulator**: Apple introduced a networking bug in iOS 18.4 that causes requests to fail when running in the Simulator. For more details, see [this thread on Apple's forums](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/777999).
