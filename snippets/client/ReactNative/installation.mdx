## Installation

Statsig uses a multi-package strategy, so you will need to install both the Statsig client and the React Native specific bindings.

<CodeGroup>
```shell NPM
npm install @statsig/react-native-bindings
```

```shell Yarn
yarn add @statsig/react-native-bindings
```
</CodeGroup>

### Peer Dependencies

The `@statsig/react-native-bindings` package has peer dependencies which may also need to be installed if they are not already in your project.

<CodeGroup>
```shell NPM
npm install react-native-device-info @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

```shell Yarn
yarn add react-native-device-info @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```
</CodeGroup>
