#### I want to customize the initialization logic, can I do that?

Yes, you can remove the client API key from the url and see the [Javascript SDK Getting Started Guide](https://docs.statsig.com/client/javascript-sdk#getting-started) for more information.  The HTML snippet is just our javascript SDK - providing an api key in the url will auto initialize an instance for you, but if you don't want that, you can use it just like the javascript SDK.

You will need to create your own instance differently than if you were installing the sdk via npm:

```js
const { StatsigClient, runStatsigAutoCapture, runStatsigSessionReplay } = window.Statsig;
    
const client = new StatsigClient(
    '<CLIENT-SDK-KEY>', 
    { userID: 'a-user' }
);

runStatsigSessionReplay(client);
runStatsigAutoCapture(client);

await client.initializeAsync();

// check gates, configs, experiments, or log events
```
