### Network Issues

Some users have reported a `ERROR: A networking error occured during POST request` messages when first initializing Statsig. This issue is solved in releases of the SDK after 3.1.0, so upgrading your SDK should solve the issue. If it persists, reach out to us in [Slack](https://statsig.com/slack).
