## Web Analytics / Auto Capture

By including the [`@statsig/web-analytics`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@statsig/web-analytics) package in your project, you can automatically capture common web events like clicks and page views. 
For more information on filtering events, enabling console log capture, and other configuration options available in web analytics, see the [Web Analytics](/webanalytics/overview) documentation.
