## Local Overrides

If you want to locally override gates/configs/experiments/layers for testing, Statsig offers convenient methods for a quick local override. Unless you call the remove method, these will be persisted session-to-session on the client's device. Note that these overrides only apply locally - they don't impact definitions in the console or elsewhere.
