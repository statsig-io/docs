## Flutter Lifecycle Hooks

Due to the nature of mobile development, apps can be closed by the operating system when they are no longer in the foreground. To be sure that all events are logged before an app is closed by the operating system, we recommend adding Statsig to the app lifecycle events. This way we can flush all pending events when an app state change is detected.

Something like the following:

```dart
// An example App Lifecycle Observer
class StatsigLifecycleObserver extends WidgetsBindingObserver {
  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) async {
    switch (state) {
      case AppLifecycleState.resumed:
        await Statsig.initialize('client-sdk-key');
        break;
      case AppLifecycleState.paused:
        await Statsig.shutdown();
        break;
    }
  }
}

```

Then in your app code, add this observer to the WidgetsBinding instance.

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(StatsigLifecycleObserver());
}
```
