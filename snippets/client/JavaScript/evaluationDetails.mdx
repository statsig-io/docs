### Evaluation Details

Each gate, config, experiment, and layer exposes `details` describing how the value was resolved.

- `reason` explains the source (e.g., `Network:Recognized`, `Cache:Unrecognized`).
- `lcut` is the last time any configuration changed in your project.
- `receivedAt` marks when this response was received, useful for judging cache staleness.

```tsx
const gate = client.getFeatureGate('a_gate');
console.log(gate.details);
// { reason: 'Cache:Recognized', lcut: 1713837126636, receivedAt: 1713838137598 }

const config = client.getDynamicConfig('a_config');
console.log(config.details);
// { reason: 'Cache:Unrecognized', lcut: 1713837126636, receivedAt: 1713838137598 }
```

See [`/sdk/debugging`](/sdk/debugging) for the full list of `reason` values.
