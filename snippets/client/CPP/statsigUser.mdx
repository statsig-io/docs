```cpp
StatsigUser user;
user.user_id = "a-user";
user.email = "developer@statsig.com";
user.custom_ids = {
    {"employeeID", "an-employee"}
};
```

### Private Attributes

Have sensitive user PII data that should not be logged? No problem, we have a solution for it! On the StatsigUser object we also have a field called `privateAttributes`, which is a simple object/dictionary that you can use to set private user attributes. Any attribute set in `privateAttributes` will only be used for evaluation/targeting, and removed from any logs before they are sent to Statsig server.

For example, if you have feature gates that should only pass for users with emails ending in "@statsig.com", but do not want to log your users' email addresses to Statsig, you can simply add the key-value pair `{ email: "my_user@statsig.com" }` to `privateAttributes` on the user and that's it!

### Updating Users

At some point, your user might need to change. To make Statsig aware of this new user, you will need to make a call to an UpdateUser function.

```cpp
client.UpdateUserSync(user);

// or, use the shared instance

StatsigClient::Shared().UpdateUserSync(user);
```

If you want to ensure you have the latest values for an update (Say you are transition from logged out to logged in). You can use the Asynchronous update function.

```cpp
{client or StatsigClient::Shared()}.UpdateUserAsync(
    user,
    [](StatsigResultCode result) {
        if (result == StatsigResultCode::Ok) {
          // do something now that the latest values have been fetched
        } else {
          // error state
        }
    }
);
```

Asynchronous vs Synchronous behaviors are the same as the Initialize functions.
