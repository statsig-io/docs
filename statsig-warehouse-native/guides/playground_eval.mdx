<Info>
Playground evaluations are only recommended for Enterprise-tier customers.
</Info>

Many customers evaluating Statsig have sensitive data & long lead times to test on production data due to privacy and data security process. Statsig offers a read-only [Demo Project](https://console.statsig.com/whn_demo), but this doesn't allow you to really experience the warehouse native product.

To solve this, you can reach out to support to ask for access to a Playground Evaluation project. This is a project hosted by Statsig with fake, near-real time data sources that can be used to set up experiments, analyze metrics, and get a feel for what it's like to use Statsig and to get internal feedback. You'll be an admin, and can add teammates as desired to explore the shared project together.

## Playground Projects

Playground projects come with some boilerplate connections hooked up:

- A real-time event streaming metric source
- A daily user-level metric source
- An assignment source with a handful of experiments
- A handful of pre-loaded metrics and experiments

<Note>
Playground projects do not come with any assign-and-analyze experiments, so some features that require SDK usage (e.g. Stratified Sampling) won't be available. A normal demo project can be used with an SDK on a local script to generate data for those use cases.
</Note>

## Evaluation

We recommend following steps 2+ from the [quick start](/statsig-warehouse-native/guides/quick-start) guide, starting with the tables available to the playground project. This will give you a sense of what it takes to run experiments and manage metrics in Statsig.

Once that's done, refer to the [POC guide](/statsig-warehouse-native/guides/running_a_poc) and simulate the steps that are relevant to your evaluation. Customers have also found it useful to explore the Pulse UI together - the Statsig team is always happy to chat about any questions or feedback.
