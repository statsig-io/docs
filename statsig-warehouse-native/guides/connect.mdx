To run analysis on your warehouse, Statsig needs to connect to your warehouse via a service user. You control the access this user gets to your warehouse. In general, Statsig will require:

- Read access to metric data and exposures data
- Write access to an isolated Statsig Staging database for writing results and exporting data
- Access to run jobs and queries
