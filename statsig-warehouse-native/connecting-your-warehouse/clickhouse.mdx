<Warning>
Statsig's Clickhouse connector is in open Beta: some functionality may not be performance-optimized or may have minor syntax errors during the beta period.

Please reach out to support for assistance getting started with Clickhouse on Statsig.
</Warning>

## Overview

To set up connection with Clickhouse, we need the following:

- The URL to connect to, e.g. https://\<ID\>.us-east1.gcp.clickhouse.cloud:8443
  - This can be found by going to the service that needs to be connect to, and clicking "Connect" in the left rail
- A database in the service where Statsig will have full CRUD access for writing logged data and intermediate tables
  - Statsig recommends that this is a new database, separate from production data
- A username/password for a Statsig database user
  - Statsig recommends making a new, standalone user for audit purposes
- An exposures table to export exposures data logged to Statsig
- An events table to export events data logged to Statsig

To create a user, the easiest way is to run:

```sql
create user <username> IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_password BY '<password>';
```

But the correct approach will depend on the best practices specified by your database administrator.

## Grant Permissions to Statsig's Account

The database user created for Statsig will need database permissions in order to access data and run workflows.

Statsig requires two levels of permission:

- Read-only access to any production data (outside of the data logged to Statsig) that will be analyzed in analytics or experimentation
- Full CRUD access within the staging database (specified above) where Statsig will write data artifacts to store results for long-running experiments

This can be granted to the Statsig user in SQL by an account with sufficient permissions.

Read:

```sql
GRANT SHOW TABLES, SHOW COLUMNS, SELECT ON <read_db>.* to <statsig_user>;
```

CRUD:

```sql
GRANT SHOW TABLES, SHOW COLUMNS, SELECT ON <statsig_db>.* to <statsig_user>;
GRANT CREATE, DROP, DELETE, ALTER, UPDATE, INSERT ON <statsig_db>.* to <statsig_user>;
```
