## Overview

To set up connection with Microsoft Fabric, you must start from the [Fabric Workload Hub](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/workloadhub/detail/Statsig.Statsig.Statsig?experience=fabric-developer).

You will need to:
- Add Statsig to your Fabric workspace
- Create a service principal with access to Fabric, OneLake, and the shared workspace where you added Statsig
- Grant access for Statsig's IP addresses to access your Microsoft Fabric account if you have firewall conditional access rules set

## Add Statsig to your Fabric workspace

1. On the [Fabric Workload Hub](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/workloadhub/detail/Statsig.Statsig.Statsig?experience=fabric-developer), click the 'Add Workload' button to enable Statsig in your selected share workspace.

## Creating a service principal
The first step is to create a service principal and their associated credentials. You'll give Statsig access to this service principal to access Fabric resources. You should create a new service principal for Statsig, but you can use the same service principal to give Statsig access to multiple Fabric resources if necessary.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. In the navigation menu, select Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).
3. Click App registrations under Manage and then click + New registration.
4. Enter a Name for your application such as "Statsig on Fabric". In the Supported account types section, select Accounts in this organizational directory only and click Register
 - Make a note of the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID. You will use them later to connect Statsig.
5. Create a secret for this application. Re-select the application you just created.
6. On the navigation menu, click Certificates & secrets and then click + New client secret.
7. In the Add a client secret pane, select an expiry period and enter a description for the client secret, eg "Statsig Credentials".
8. Click Add and make a note of the client secret.

## Configuring Fabric to allow external access via service principals
1. Click the Settings icon in the top right of the Fabric workspace.
2. Select [admin portal](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/admin-portal?experience=fabric-developer) under Governance and insights.
3. In the navigation menu, select Tenant settings.
4. In the Developer settings section, set the Service principals can use Fabric APIs toggle to ON.
5. In the OneLake settings section, set the Users can access data stored in OneLake with apps external to Fabric toggle to ON.
  
## Granting the service principal access to your workspace
Any resources you wish to connect to must also be placed in a shared workspace. Once you have a shared workspace, you'll need to grant your new service principal access to the workspace.

1. Select the workspace and then click Manage Access.
2. Click + Add people or groups.
3. Select the name of the service principal you created in Step 1. If it doesn't appear, make sure you've enabled the Service principals can use Fabric APIs setting above.
4. In the drop-down menu, select Contributor.

The service principal can now access any resource within the workspace given the appropriate endpoint.

### What IP addresses will Statsig access data warehouses from?

[See FAQ](/data-warehouse-ingestion/faq#what-ip-addresses-will-statsig-access-data-warehouses-from) to add Statsig's IP addresses in your firewall to only allow traffic originating from Statsig to access your Microsoft Fabric account. You can specify IP addresses to allow as part of [Microsoft Entra's conditional access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/protect-inbound-traffic#entra-conditional-access). 

For Microsoft Fabric, Statsig uses 4.242.112.193 but it is recommended to allowlist all Statsig IP addresses.
