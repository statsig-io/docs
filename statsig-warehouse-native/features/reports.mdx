## Report Summary

Summaries are how experiment results are combined with context and discussion to produce long-term records of what you learned through running the experiment. This lives on the Statsig console, but can be exported as a PDF to your learnings library.

This will capture results and in-context discussion, as well as allowing you to embed media, charts,and rich text formatting for deeper discussion and sharing of follow-ups from outside of Statsig.
