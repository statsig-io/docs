In general it is a good practice to establish a run-time for an experiment

- This aligns teams around timelines
- For fixed-horizon analysis, this establishes when it is valid to make a conclusion based off of the results

The way to do this is by establishing the size of impact you want to be able to consistently measure, if it exists (known as the "MDE" or minimum detectable effect) and run an analysis to determine how many samples - and time - you will need to achieve that MDE.

### Running a Power Analysis

To run a power analysis in Statsig, you need to provide 2 inputs:

- A population
  - This step is critical as most experiments will only reach a subset of users, and these users may have different behavior than the overall population
  - You can base the population on an experiment you already ran, or on a Qualifying Event
  - A qualifying event is an arbitrary set of historical user-timestamp pairs - for example, if you plan to expose on a button click, you could provide the
    users who clicked that button in the week before
- Metrics
  - Enter the metrics you plan to use as your evaluation criteria for your experiment. You can add multiple metrics, which can be a useful way to analyze
    which metrics will be more or less sensitive in your target population

### Readout

Statsig will simulate an experiment based on your input, calculating population sizes and the relative variance based on historical behavior.

The power analysis readout will show you a week by week view of the experiment Stats you can expect to see.

In the settings section, you can specify

- **Number of Experiment Groups**: The total number of groups in the experiment, including control.
- **Control Group %**: What percent of users will be in the control group, e.g. 50% if half of all users will be control.
- **Fixed Allocation or Fixed MDE Analysis**: Different types of analyses you want to run. See [here](https://docs.statsig.com/experiments-plus/power-analysis/#analysis-types) for more details.
- **One-sided or Two-sided test**: Toggle this setting to select the type of z-test to use for the analysis.
- **Significant Level (α)**
- **Power (1-β)**
- **Bonferroni Correction Per Variant**: Whether to include α correction for multiple tests in power analysis

These will update your results based on the analysis that already ran.
