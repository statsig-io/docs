# Welcome to Statsig Documentation
Statsig is the complete platform for product growth, empowering your team to build and innovate like the best tech companies in the world.

You can use Statsig’s products directly with your own data warehouse through [Warehouse Native](/statsig-warehouse-native/introduction). This allows you to leverage Statsig’s features while keeping data in your existing infrastructure.

## Getting Started with Statsig
Statsig supports over **30 SDKs and frameworks**, allowing you to quickly integrate with your application, whether you’re building for the web, mobile, or server environments. Follow these simple steps to get started in minutes:
## Add Statsig to Your Website (JavaScript Snippet)

The easiest way to get up and running is by adding the Statsig JavaScript snippet to your website. This setup takes just a few seconds:

Paste the following code into the `<head>` section of your website, replacing `"YOUR_CLIENT_KEY"` with your project’s **Client API Key**, which you can find in the [Statsig Console](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@statsig/js-client@3/build/statsig-js-client+session-replay+web-analytics.min.js?apikey=[YOUR_CLIENT_KEY]"></script>
```

Once installed, you’ll be able to:
- Start **recording events**.
- Use **session replays**.
- Leverage Statsig’s **experiments** and **feature flags** right away.

## Explore SDKs 

For greater control, Statsig offers SDKs for a wide variety of platforms, including JavaScript, Python, iOS, Android, and more. Select the SDK that fits your project and follow the installation guide:
