# What is Statsig?
Statsig is the single platform to ship, test and analyze new features. Statsig provides the most advanced [Experimentation](/experiments-plus) and [Feature Flagging](/feature-flags/working-with) tools available, in a platform with full-featured [Product Analytics](/product-analytics/overview), [Session Replay](/session-replay/overview), and more. We believe the best way to build products is with data, and [our mission](https://statsig.com/company) is to democratize data across companies of all sizes. 

You can use Statsig with our infrastructure, or plug into your existing metrics with our Warehouse Native product:

# Getting Started with Statsig
## JavaScript Snippet

The easiest way to get started is to add the Statsig JS script to your website, which takes only a few seconds. 

Paste the below code into the `<head>` section of your website, replacing "YOUR_CLIENT_KEY" with a Client API Key from your Statsig project, which you can find at [console.statsig.com/api_keys](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys). This will start [recording events](/webanalytics/overview) & [session replays](/session-replay/overview), and give you access to [experiments](/experiments-plus) & [feature flags](/feature-flags/working-with) right away.

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@statsig/js-client@2/build/statsig-js-client+session-replay+web-analytics.min.js?apikey=[YOUR_CLIENT_KEY]"></script>
```
