 - By default, each experiment runs in its own layer. When you want to exclude any users exposed to other experiments, check the **Select an existing layer** option to see what percentage of users are available for this experiment. In the example below, 60% of the users in a layer are available for this experiment. This means that you can define the experiment size to be a percentage that's less than or equal to 60%.
