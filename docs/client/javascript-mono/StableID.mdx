## StableID

StableID is a concept in Statsig that allows us to have a consistent identifier for a single device. 
This allows Statsig to run [experiments on logged out](/guides/first-device-level-experiment) users (users without a UserID) 
as well as target gates on the device level rather than the user level.


### How it works

When you initialize the SDK for the first time, it checks if a StableID is already present in local storage. 
If it's missing, the SDK generates a new StableID and saves it in local storage. On subsequent initializations, 
the SDK retrieves and reuses the previously stored StableID.

The StableID is stored in local storage under the key `statsig.stable_id.<SDK_KEY_HASH>`. 
Each SDK key has its own StableID, meaning that if you're using multiple SDK keys, each one will have a separate StableID.

It's important to note that local storage is not shared across different domains or subdomains. 
This means that if you are working across multiple domains or subdomains, the StableID will be isolated to each domain's local storage.

If you need a StableID to persist across domains, you'll need to implement your own mechanism to store and retrieve the StableID, such as using a cookie. 
By setting the StableID in a cookie with a shared domain scope, you can ensure that the same ID is accessible across multiple domains.

The Statsig SDK does not use any cookies itself.

### Accessing the StableID

You can access StableID that the Statsig client is using by calling `getContext()` and then checking the `stableID` field.

### Overriding StableID

If your app already has something similar to a StableID and you would prefer to use that instead, 
you can override the default behavior by simply passing your value in as part of the `StatsigUser` object.


<Tabs
  defaultValue="js"
  groupId="language-choice"
  values={[
    {label: 'Javascript', value: 'js'},
    {label: 'React', value: 'react'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="js">

<GitHubEmbed url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsig-io/js-client-monorepo/main/samples/react/src/samples/precomputed-client/sample-precomp-stable-id-overrride.tsx" />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::note

Once overridden, the new StableID will be persisted to local storage so it will be used for future sessions.

### Keeping StableID Consistent

If you have a backend service running a Statsig SDK as well as using the Statsig client in your frontend, 
you may need to have the same StableID accessible in both environments.

It is highly dependent on your setup, but usually you can send the StableID up with any requests from your frontend. 
If the backend ever receives a request without a StableID, it can generate one and have the client store it (usually as a cookie) for future requests.

Because Server SDKs are designed to handle multiple Users, they do not generate their own StableIDs.

Here is an example showing how you might use a cookie to share the StableID across client and server and use it bootstrap the client SDK.
