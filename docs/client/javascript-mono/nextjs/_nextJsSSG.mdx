## Statsig Site Generation (SSG)

Vercel's [Static Site Generation](https://vercel.com/blog/nextjs-server-side-rendering-vs-static-generation) renders the HTML for your site at build time (rather than request time), optimizing the performance of HTML delivery. Static pre-rendered content can't be responsive, so its difficult to run experiments on, or flag your features. We recommend two approaches to experimenting on Static-Generated Content:
 - **1. Use Vercel's Edge Middleware:** With the Edge Middleware and tools like [Statsig's Edge Config Adapter](https://docs.statsig.com/integrations/vercel/#using-the-statsig-sdk), you can experiment on the entirety of your static generated content with zero-latency redirect tests.
 - **2. Isolate Statsig Usage to Hydrated Elements:** Often SSG'd pages are "hydrated" with addition client-rendered content that is more responsive and dynamic. Statsig usage can be isolated to these elements, supporting SSG's first-render speeds, and loading in experimented content after the fact. 

 Typically, approach #2 is executed by installing the \<StatsigProvider> only around content that will be client-side rendered. In some cases, you might have multiple client-rendered components without a common parent - in those cases you'll need multiple StatsigProviders, while having them share a single client instance. Do this by initializing a StatsigClient using the regular javascript syntax: 

 ```jsx
 const myStatsigClient = new StatsigClient(YOUR_SDK_KEY, user, options);
 await myStatsigClient.initializeAsync();
 ```

 And then plug this client object into the providers as needed, managing the client object as a singleton if needed.

 ```jsx
<StatsigProvider client={myStatsigClient}>
        <YourComponent />
</StatsigProvider>

<StatsigProvider client={myStatsigClient}>
        <YourComponent />
</StatsigProvider>
 ```
