import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";


Note since the `@statsig/expo-bindings` works in conjunction with `@statsig/react-bindings` and `@statsig/js-client`, 
documentation on those packages is also relevant for Expo implementations:

- [@statsig/js-client documentation](/client/javascript-sdk)
- [@statsig/react-bindings documentation](/client/javascript-sdk)

## Installation

To use Statsig in Expo, you will need to install the Statsig Expo specific bindings.

```shell
npx expo install @statsig/expo-bindings
```


### Peer Dependencies

The `@statsig/expo-bindings` package has peer dependencies which may also need to be installed if they are not already in your project.

```shell
npx expo install expo-device expo-application @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```
