import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";


Note since the `@statsig/expo-bindings` works in conjuction with `@statsig/react-bindings` and `@statsig/js-client`, 
documentation on those packages is also relevant for Expo implementations:

- [@statsig/js-client documentation](/client/javascript-sdk)
- [@statsig/react-bindings documentation](/client/javascript-sdk)

## Installation

Statsig uses a multi-package strategy, so you will need to install both the Statsig client and the Expo
specific bindings.

```shell
npx expo install @statsig/js-client @statsig/expo-bindings
```


### Peer Dependecies

The `@statsig/expo-bindings` package has peer dependencies which will also need to be installed. 
[`react-native-mmkv`](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv?tab=readme-ov-file#expo) is utilized to allow for synchronous storage, similar to LocalStorage in web environments.

```shell
npx expo install expo-device expo-application react-native-mmkv
npx expo prebuild
```
