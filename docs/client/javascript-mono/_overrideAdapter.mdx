## Overrides (OverrideAdapter)

In the new javascript SDKs, we provide an OverrideAdapter interface that you can customize, plus a ready-to-use version called LocalOverrideAdapter that should work for most use cases. Add it to your instance at initialization time, and it should behave intuitively, allowing you to override any config. 

```jsx
import { LocalOverrideAdapter } from '@statsig/js-local-overrides';
const overrideAdapter = new LocalOverrideAdapter(); // <-- instantiate here 
overrideAdapter.overrideGate('gate_a', false);
overrideAdapter.overrideGate('gate_b', true);

const client = new StatsigClient(
    DEMO_CLIENT_KEY,
    { userID: 'a-user' },
    {
    logLevel: LogLevel.Debug,
    overrideAdapter, //<-- Add to your instance here
    },
);
```

### Making these overrides "sticky"
In other client SDKs, overrides persist on an individual device between sessions. The LocalOverrideAdapter supports this - but given that the SDK also supports [Multi-Instance](#multiple-client-instances), you should pass your SDK key into the LocalOverrideAdapter to serve as a unique key for each instance's overrides in storage. 

```jsx
const overrideAdapter = new LocalOverrideAdapter("client-XXXXXXXXX"); // <-- adding the client key enables persistent overriding.
```
