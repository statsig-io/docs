You can configure certain aspects of the SDKs behavior by passing a StatsigOptions object during initialization.

- **api**: `string`
  - The API to use for all SDK network requests. You should not need to override this unless you have another API that implements the Statsig API endpoints.
- **environment**: `StatsigEnvironment`
  - An object you can use to set environment variables that apply to all of your users in the same session.
- **overrideStableID**: `string`
  - Overrides the auto-generated StableID that is set for the device.
- **logLevel**: `LogLevel`, default `LogLevel.Error`
  - How much information is allowed to be printed to the console.
- **dataProviders**: `StatsigDataProvider[]`, default LocalStorageCache then Network
  - Implementors used to customize the initialization flow.
- **networkTimeoutMs**: `number`, default `10,000`
  - The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) that any network request can take before timing out.
- **loggingBufferMaxSize**: `number`, default `50`
  - The maximum number of events to batch before flushing logs to Statsig.
- **loggingIntervalMs**: `number`, default `10,000`
  - How often (in milliseconds) to flush logs to Statsig.
