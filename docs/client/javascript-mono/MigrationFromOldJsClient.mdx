The architecture and majority of the APIs in the updated SDK have been retained; however,
 modifications have been made to address common pitfalls, resolve existing issues, and streamline the SDK logic.

Below is a list of identified breaking changes that will require manual refactoring:

### Initialization

Previously, the SDK employed a single method for initialization. However, we have recognized that waiting for a method call during app startup can be impractical. Consequently, we have introduced two distinct initialization approaches: one synchronous and one asynchronous.

Synchronous initialization will leverage cache (if available), returning immediately. Data for subsequent sessions will then be fetched in the background.

Asynchronous initialization, on the other hand, is awaitable and ensures that the most current data is fetched and used.

  defaultValue="new"
  values={[
    {label: 'statsig-js (Legacy)', value: 'legacy'},
    {label: 'New', value: 'new'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="legacy">

```typescript
import Statsig from "statsig-js";

// initialize returns a promise which always resolves
await Statsig.initialize(
  "client-sdk-key",
  { userID: "some_user_id" },
  { environment: { tier: "staging" } } // optional, pass options here if needed
);
```

### Bootstrapping
If you are using a server SDK to bootstrap your js/react app, you will need to make some updates to how your server SDK generates values.  One of the optimizations we made with this new js-client SDK was to remove the `sha256` library for hashing gate/experiment names.  Instead, we use a `djb2` hash.  By default, all server SDKs generate `sha256` hashes of gate/experiment names in the `getClientInitializeResponse` method.  You will need to set the hash algorithm parameter to that method call to `"djb2"` instead in order to bootstrap this new client SDK.  One of the benefits to this hashing algorithm is it will make the entire payload smaller as well, so its a net win on package size, speed, and payload size for the SDK.

For example, if you are bootstrapping from a nodejs app, you will need to do:

```js
statsig.getClientInitializeResponse(
  user,
  '[client-key]',
  {
    hash: 'djb2',
  },
);
```








### Updating the User

Similar to initialization, the `updateUser` method now supports both synchronous and asynchronous approaches. Each method functions in the same manner as the initialization process.

<Tabs
  groupId="js-migration-choice"
  defaultValue="new"
  values={[
    {label: 'statsig-js (Legacy)', value: 'legacy'},
    {label: 'New', value: 'new'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="legacy">

```typescript
import Statsig from "statsig-js";

const user = { userID: "a-user" };

await Statsig.updateUser(user);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="new">

<GitHubEmbed url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsig-io/js-client-monorepo/main/samples/react/src/samples/precomputed-client/sample-precomp-update-user.tsx" />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>









## Static Instance

In the previous SDK version, there was a top-level static interface for using Statsig. To enhance support for multiple instances,
we have replaced this with a static method that retrieves an instance.

<Tabs
  groupId="js-migration-choice"
  defaultValue="new"
  values={[
    {label: 'statsig-js (Legacy)', value: 'legacy'},
    {label: 'New', value: 'new'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="legacy">

```typescript
import Statsig from "statsig-js";

await Statsig.initialize(YOUR_CLIENT_KEY, { userID: 'a-user' });

// then later, at some other location in your code base
if (Statsig.checkGate('a_gate')) { 
  // do something...
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="new">

<GitHubEmbed url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsig-io/js-client-monorepo/main/samples/react/src/samples/precomputed-client/sample-precomp-static-instance.tsx" />

## GDPR

In certain use cases, it is necessary to suspend cache and network usage until the user grants specific 
permissions. Previously, the method for achieving this was somewhat fragmented. 
In the new SDK, these functionalities have been consolidated for improved coherence and ease of implementation.

<Tabs
  groupId="js-migration-choice"
  defaultValue="new"
  values={[
    {label: 'statsig-js (Legacy)', value: 'legacy'},
    {label: 'New', value: 'new'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="legacy">

```typescript
// start the SDK without storage or logging
Statsig.initialize(
  'client-key',
  { userID: 'a_user' },
  { disableAllLogging: true, disableLocalStorage: true },
);

// then, once permission was granted
Statsig.shutdown();
Statsig.initialize(
  'client-key',
  { userID: 'a_user' },
  { disableAllLogging: false, disableLocalStorage: false },
);

// or, by manually flipping the related flags
Statsig.reenableAllLogging();
StatsigLocalStorage.disabled = false;
```
