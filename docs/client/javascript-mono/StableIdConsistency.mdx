## Overview

StableID is a concept in Statsig that allows us to have a consistent identifier for a single device. 
This allows us to run [experiments on logged out](/guides/first-device-level-experiment) users (Users without a User ID) 
as well as target gates on the device level rather than the user level.


## How it works

The first time you initialize the SDK, we will check if you have a StableID set in local storage. If not, we will generate a new StableID and set it in local storage. 
Then the next time you initialize the SDK, we will check for the StableID in local storage and reuse it.

The StableID is written to local storage under the key `statsig.stable_id.<SDK_KEY_HASH>`. This means that if you have multiple SDK keys, each key will have its own StableID.

## Accessing the StableID

You can access StableID that the Statsig client is using by calling `getContext()` and then checking.

## Overriding StableID

If your app already has something similar to a StableID and you would prefer to use that instead, 
you can override the default behavior by simply passing your value in as part of the `StatsigUser` object.


<Tabs
  defaultValue="js"
  groupId="language-choice"
  values={[
    {label: 'Javascript', value: 'js'},
    {label: 'React', value: 'react'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="js">

<GitHubEmbed url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsig-io/js-client-monorepo/main/samples/react/src/samples/precomputed-client/sample-precomp-stable-id-overrride.tsx" />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::note

Once overridden, the new StableID will be persisted to local storage so it will be used for future sessions.

## Keeping StableID Consistent

If you have a backend service running a Statsig SDK as well as using the Statsig client in your frontend, 
you may need to have the same StableID accessible in both environments.

It is highly dependent on your setup, but usually you can send the StableID up with any requests from your frontend. 
If the backend ever receives a request without a StableID, it can generate one and have the client store it for future requests.

Because Server SDKs are designed to handle multiple Users, they do not generate their own StableIDs.

Here is an example using a shared StableID to bootstrap the Statsig client SDK.
