## Data Adapter

The `StatsigDataAdapter` type outlines
how the PrecomputedEvaluationsClient should cache and fetch data during initialize and update operations. By default, the PrecomputedEvaluationsClient uses `EvaluationsDataAdapter` which
provides ways to fetch data synchronously from Local Storage and asynchronously from Statsig's servers.
See [Using EvaluationsDataAdapter](/client/javascript-sdk/using-evaluations-data-adapter) to learn more and see example usage.

It provides three functions:

- `attach` - Called when the StatsigDataAdapter passed into a Statsig client via StatsigOptions. This allows the StatsigDataAdapter to use
  the same SDK Key and StatsigOptions as the Statsig client.

  - ```typescript
    attach: (sdkKey: string, options: StatsigOptionsCommon | null) => void
    ```

- `getDataSync` - Called during initializeSync and/or updateUserSync. It is also called during async update operations before StatsigDataAdapter.getDataAsync is called.
  A synchronous way to get values for the given StatsigUser. Useful for things like caching and bootstrapping.

  - ```typescript
    getDataSync: (user?: StatsigUser) => StatsigDataAdapterResult | null;
    ```

- `getDataAsync` - Called during initializeAsync and/or updateUserAsync. An asynchronous way to get values for the given StatsigUser. Useful for things like
  fetching latest values from network.

  - ```typescript
    getDataAsync: (
      current: StatsigDataAdapterResult | null,
      user?: StatsigUser
    ) => Promise<StatsigDataAdapterResult | null>;
    ```
