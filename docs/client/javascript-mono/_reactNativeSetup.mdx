## React Native Specific Setup

### Create a Client

Creating a Statsig client when using React Native has a slight
twist when compared to pure JavaScript environments.

Because storage in React Native is async (See [AsyncStorage](https://reactnative.dev/docs/asyncstorage)), a warming step is required
to load any cache values from disk. This warming performs some AsyncStorage.getItem operations that block the
`StatsigProviderRN` from rendering.

### Render the StatsigProvider

Once the Statsig client is created and the warming step started, we can then pass them into
the `StatsigProviderRN` component for rendering.

```typescript
export function App(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <StatsigProviderRN client={myStatsigClient} cacheWarming={warming}>
      {/* Render your App */}
    </StatsigProviderRN>
  );
}
```

### Android networking
We have seen reports that the default networking client on react native for android can error out with:

```
ERROR  [Statsig] A networking error occured during POST request to https://featureassets.org/v1/initialize
```

Please let us know if you hit this, but for now the suggested workaround is to append this `content-type` for all requests:
```
const customFetcher = (uri, args) => {
  args.headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    ...args.headers,
  };
  return fetch(uri, args);
};

const myStatsigClient = new StatsigClient(
  'YOUR_KEY',
  {
    userID: "YOUR_USER_ID",
  },
  {
    networkConfig: {
      networkOverrideFunc: customFetcher,
    },
  }
);
```


## Hooks

All hooks are re-exported from the `@statsig/react-bindings` package (See [Hooks](/client/javascript-sdk/react#hooks)). 
They can be imported through `@statsig/react-native-bindings` or directly through the `@statsig/react-bindings` peer dependency.

```js
import { useFeatureGate, useStatsigClient } from '@statsig/react-native-bindings';
```
