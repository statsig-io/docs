## React Native Specific Setup

The setup for a ReactNative environment is very similar to a plain [React environment](/client/javascript-sdk/react). 
The only difference is that you need to use the ReactNative specific `StatsigProviderRN`. 
This automatically switches out the storage layer used by the SDK, utilizing [`react-native-mmkv`](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv) instead of LocalStorage (which isn't available in RN environments).


```typescript
import {
  StatsigProviderRN,
  useClientAsyncInit,
  useFeatureGate,
} from '@statsig/react-native-bindings';

function Content() {
  const gate = useFeatureGate('a_gate');

  return <div>Reason: {gate.details.reason}</div>; // Reason: Network or NetworkNotModified
}

function App() {
  const { client, isLoading } = useClientAsyncInit(YOUR_CLIENT_KEY, {
    userID: 'a-user',
  });

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <StatsigProviderRN client={client}>
      <Content />
    </StatsigProviderRN>
  );
}
```

**Note**: There are a few different ways to initialize the StatsigClient, with trade-offs between latency and up-to-date values.
You can read [Initialization Strategies](init-strategies) to learn more.

### Android networking
We have seen reports that the default networking client on react native for android can error out with:

```
ERROR  [Statsig] A networking error occured during POST request to https://featureassets.org/v1/initialize
```

Please let us know if you hit this, but for now the suggested workaround is to append this `content-type` for all requests:
```
const customFetcher = (uri, args) => {
  args.headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    ...args.headers,
  };
  return fetch(uri, args);
};

const myStatsigClient = new StatsigClient(
  'YOUR_KEY',
  {
    userID: "YOUR_USER_ID",
  },
  {
    networkConfig: {
      networkOverrideFunc: customFetcher,
    },
  }
);
```


## Hooks

All hooks are re-exported from the `@statsig/react-bindings` package (See [Hooks](/client/javascript-sdk/react#hooks)). 
They can be imported through `@statsig/react-native-bindings` or directly through the `@statsig/react-bindings` peer dependency.

```js
import { useFeatureGate, useStatsigClient } from '@statsig/react-native-bindings';
```
