### Async timeouts

For the Statsig client calls that hit the network (initializeAsync and updateUserAsync), it is possible to specify a maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) that the method is allowed to take before the promise is resolved.

If this timeout is hit, the promise will resolve and cached values will be used (If any are available). 
The network request will continue and upon a response, will write values to cache so the will be available for subsequent calls.
