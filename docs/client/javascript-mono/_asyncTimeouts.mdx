## Common Targeting Use-Cases
To target based on a cookie (for logged in users, for example) or based on a UTM parameter (or any query string parameter), you can do so by config a [Custom Field Targeting Rule](https://docs.statsig.com/feature-flags/conditions/#custom) in Statsig Console. This can be configured directly as an _inline experiment targeting rule_ on an experiment — or — as a feature flag condition.

This requires javascript code to capture the cookie or the UTM from the browser and pass it to Statsig SDK in the user object during initialization. The below code shows a simplified example of how you can achieve this. Please make sure to modify as desired and test your implementation thoroughly. 
```js
const user = {
  custom: {
    isLoggedIn: cookieLib.get('isLoggedIn'),
    utm: new URL(window.location.href).searchParams.get("utm")
  }
}
const myStatsigClient = new StatsigClient(YOUR_SDK_KEY, user, options);
```

### Async timeouts

For the Statsig client calls that hit the network (initializeAsync and updateUserAsync), it is possible to specify a maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) that the method is allowed to take before the promise is resolved.

<GitHubEmbed url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsig-io/js-client-monorepo/main/samples/react/src/samples/precomputed-client/sample-precomp-initialize-timeouts.tsx" />


If this timeout is hit, the promise will resolve and cached values will be used (If any are available). 
The network request will continue and upon a response, will write values to cache so the will be available for subsequent calls.

If you'd like to avoid a network request entirely, see [initialization strategies](/client/javascript-sdk/init-strategies) for more options.
