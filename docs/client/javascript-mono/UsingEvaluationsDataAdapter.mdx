The `StatsigEvaluationsDataAdapter` is the default `EvaluationsDataAdapter` used by a `StatsigClient` instance.

It handles fetching and caching values from Statsig's servers. If required, you can create your own custom `EvaluationsDataAdapter`
and provide it to the Statsig client via [StatsigOptions.dataAdapter](/client/javascript-sdk#statsig-options).

## Overview

### Synchronous Behavior (Cache)

When callling `StatsigClient.initalizeSync`, the `StatsigEvaluationsDataAdapter` will load values
from Cache and provide them to the client. The client will also call refresh in the background via
`StatsigEvaluationsDataAdapter.getDataAsync`, leading to values lagging until the next time `initializeSync` or `updateUserSync` is called.

In practice (Unless an additional update call is made), this means that for the very first session of a given user, there will be no values, and not until the next session will the cache have values.

### Asynchronous Behavior (Network)

When callling `StatsigClient.initializeAsync`, the `StatsigEvaluationsDataAdapter` will load values
from Cache and provide them to the client. The client will then block on a call to `StatsigEvaluationsDataAdapter.getDataAsync`,
allowing the ability to await the latest values from Statsig.

If you want the latest values, but do not want to await the asynchronous call, you may call `initializeAsync` and simply `.catch` the promise. Note that
this could lead to values changing mid-session as newer values arrive from the network.

### Getting the Data Adapter

### Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping allows you to provide data for a given `StatsigUser`. This can be useful if you are are running a
Statsig Server SDK on your backend and do not wish to make unneccesary network calls (See [statsig-node](/server/nodejsServerSDK#bootstrap)'s getClientInitializeResponse).

This approach can also be useful if you are building a mobile app and want to bundle values with your application. Then you can load the values from a local file at startup and provide them to the data adapter.

If you are using a server SDK to bootstrap your js/react app, you will need to make some updates to how your server SDK generates values.  One of the optimizations we made with this new js-client SDK was to remove the `sha256` library for hashing gate/experiment names.  Instead, we use a `djb2` hash.  By default, all server SDKs generate `sha256` hashes of gate/experiment names in the `getClientInitializeResponse` method.  You will need to set the hash algorithm parameter to that method call to `"djb2"` instead in order to bootstrap this new client SDK.  One of the benefits to this hashing algorithm is it will make the entire payload smaller as well, so its a net win on package size, speed, and payload size for the SDK.

For example, if you are bootstrapping from a nodejs app, you will need to do:

```js
statsig.getClientInitializeResponse(
  user,
  '[client-key]',
  {
    hash: 'djb2',
  },
);
```

### Custom Implementation

If you would like to customize when and how data is fetched, as well as where it is stored, you can create your own class the conforms to the `EvaluationsDataAdapter` type.

The `EvaluationsDataAdapter` type outlines the following functions:

`attach` - Called when the `EvaluationsDataAdapter` is passed into a `StatsigClient` via `StatsigOptions`. This allows the `EvaluationsDataAdapter` to use
  the same SDK Key and `StatsigOptions` as the `StatsigClient` instance.

```typescript
attach: (
  sdkKey: string, 
  options: StatsigOptionsCommon | null
) => void
```

---

`getDataSync` - Synchronously get evaluation data for the given user. Called during initializeSync and/or updateUserSync. It is also called during
  async update operations before StatsigDataAdapter.getDataAsync is called.

```typescript
getDataSync: (user: StatsigUser) => DataAdapterResult | null;
```

---

`getDataAsync` - Asynchronously get evaluation data for the given user. Called during initializeAsync and/or updateUserAsync.
```typescript
getDataAsync: (
  current: DataAdapterResult | null, 
  user: StatsigUser
) => Promise<DataAdapterResult | null>;
```

---

`prefetchData` - Manually trigger a fetch for new evaluations data for the given user.
```typescript
prefetchData: (user: StatsigUser) => Promise<void>;
```

---

`setData` - Manually set the evaluations data from a JSON string received from a Statsig Server SDK's `getClientInitializeResponse` method.

```typescript
setData: (data: string) => Promise<void>;
```
Note: You can use <code>setDataLegacy</code> if your Server SDK is outdated.
<details>
  <summary>setData is supported by the following Statsig Server SDKs</summary>
   <ul>
    <li>node-js-server-sdk@5.20.0</li>

`setDataLegacy` - Manually set evaluations data for the given user.

This method is **deprecated** and is provided only to support older versions of Statsig server SDKs.

```typescript
setDataLegacy: (data: string, user: StatsigUser) => void;
```
