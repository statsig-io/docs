## Setup

To use Statsig in React, you first must create an instance of the Statsig client and then pass it as a Prop to a StatsigProvider.

This will set your client as part of the [StatsigContext](https://github.com/statsig-io/js-client-monorepo/blob/main/packages/react-bindings/src/StatsigContext.ts) 
and make it available to all Statsig [hooks](#hooks).

### Initialize the SDK

The easiest way to get up and running with Statsig in React environments is to use the "setup" hooks provided by
the `@statsig/react-bindings` package.

The following utilizes the `useClientAsyncInit` hook to create and initialize a StatsigClient instance. 
Under the hood, `useClientAsyncInit` calls `StatsigClient.initializeAsync`. This call will load values from cache and provide them to 
the client. The client will then fetch the latest values from the network.  

There is also a `isLoading` flag returned by this hook. You need to wait until this is true to get the most up to date feature gate and experiment values.

**Note**: There are a few different ways to initialize the StatsigClient, with trade-offs between latency and up-to-date values.
