### Client Event Emitter

It is possible to subscribe to StatsigClientEvents (Not to be confused with [StatsigEvent](#event-logging)). These events occur at various stages while using the Statsig client.
You can subscribe to specific events by specifying the StatsigClientEvent name, or, all events by using the wildcard token `'*'`.
