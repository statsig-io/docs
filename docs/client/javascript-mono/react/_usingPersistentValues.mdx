## Using Persistent Evaluations

If you want to ensure that a user's variant stays consistent while an experiment is running, regardless of changes to allocation or targeting, you can use [Persistent Assignment](/client/concepts/persistent_assignment), which lets you plug-in a storage solution to persist historical evaluations for a user. 

Implementing in React is similar to the [Javascript Usage](/client/javascript-sdk#using-persistent-evaluations), and you can also refer to our [examples on Github](https://github.com/statsig-io/js-client-monorepo/tree/main/samples/next-js/src/app/persisted-user-storage-example).
