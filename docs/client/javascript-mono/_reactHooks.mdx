## More Hooks

The `react-bindings` package exposes some hooks for convenience.

:::caution
When a hook is called to fetch a value, an exposure log is automatically triggered. 
If the check only happens conditionally, or later in a dialog, you will over expose your experiment!  

We recommend using the `useStatsigClient` hook for these cases where you need the value conditionally, and then issuing the check inline later. 
Read on for more details.

### Client Initialization Hooks

To make setup easier, there are a few different hooks provided. These should be used outside of the `StatsigProvider` and should only need to be used once.

- (recommend): `useClientAsyncInit` - Returns a client that asynchornously fetches the latest values from Statsig.
- `useClientBootstrapInit` - Returns a client loaded with the values provided to through the hook. 
Values can be generated through the use of a Statsig server SDK.

**Note**: You do not need to use the provided hooks to initialize a `StatsigClient`, and instead can opt to write you own initialization logic. See [Initialization Strategies](init-strategies).

### Client Retriveval Hooks

While there are all the other hooks documented here for get values/configurations, sometimes you still need to access the StatsigClient directly.

To get the StatsigClient instance that is being used inside a `StatsigProvider`, you can call the `useStatsigClient` hook. 
This will return an object containing the `client` ([`StatsigClient`](/client/javascript-sdk)) instance as well as the other hoisted functions outlined below.

```tsx
import {
  useStatsigClient,
} from '@statsig/react-bindings';

// Get the Client instance
const { client } = useStatsigClient();

// Call any arbitrary function on StatsigClient
console.log("StableID", client.getContext().stableID);
```

### FeatureGate Hooks

There are three different ways to check a gate using hooks:

- (recommended): `useStatsigClient.checkGate` is the safest way to check a gate, as it forces you to issue the check (and hence log the exposure) as close to the actual difference in experience as possible
- `useGateValue` is a convience hook that returns the boolean value and is the most basic way to check if a gate is enabled.
- `useFeatureGate` returns the `FeatureGate` object, if you need to check more information about the gate.

Note: `useGateValue` and `useFeatureGate` will log an exposure on render. `useStatsigClient.checkGate` will log an exposure when the function is called.

### DynamicConfig Hooks

- (recommended): `useStatsigClient.getDynamicConfig` will trigger an exposure only when called
- `useDynamicConfig` is a convience hook that returns the boolean value and is the most basic way to check if a gate is enabled.

Note: `useDynamicConfig` will log an exposure on render. `useStatsigClient.getDynamicConfig` will log an exposure when the function is called.

### Experiment Hooks

- (recommended): `useStatsigClient.getExperiment` is the safest way to check an experiment, as it forces you to issue the check (and hence log the exposure) as close to the actual difference in experience as possible
- `useExperiment` is a convience hook that returns the experiment and logs an exposure on render

### Layer Hooks
- (recommended): `useStatsigClient.getLayer` in line with our other recommendations, but matters less for layers as exposures are triggered only when calling `.get` on a parameter
- `useLayer` is a convience hook that returns the layer.  This does not log an exposure

### Log Event Hook

Using the `useStatsigClient` hook, it is possible to get hold of the `logEvent` function.

### StatsigUser Hook

This hooks provides a way to get the current `StatsigUser` as well as providing methods for updating that user.
