### Updating Users

At some point, you will probably need to change the StatsigUser being used by the Statsig client. To do this you need to call `await updateUserAsync` which will fetch the new values for the updated user.

In advanced use cases, you may want to Prefetch or Bootstrap (provide) values for a different set of user properties. See [Using EvaluationsDataAdapter](/client/javascript-sdk/using-evaluations-data-adapter) to learn more.
