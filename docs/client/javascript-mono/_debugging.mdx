## Debugging

If you run into issues when implementing Statsig, or are receiving values you do not understand, you can try some of the following to get yourself unstuck.

### Enable Debug Logging

By setting the log level to the most verbose (`Debug`), the SDK will print more information around the internal operations it is performing.

```ts
import { LogLevel, StatsigClient, StatsigOptions } from '@statsig/js-client';

const client = new StatsigClient(YOUR_CLIENT_KEY, { userID: 'a-user'}, {
    logLevel: LogLevel.Debug, // <- Print Everything
});
```


### Access \_\_STATSIG\_\_ Global

If you see issues appearing, but only for certain environments, 
it can be useful to open the web browsers debugger and view the Statsig client instance. 

- Open the web browsers console. In Chrome, this is under `View > Developer > JavaScript Console`.
- In the console, enter `__STATSIG__`. This will print the global Statsig state object, containing all internal state of the SDK.
- eg `__STATSIG__.instance()._logger._queue` is the queued events array

### View Network Logs

To see all traffic that is being sent via the Statsig SDK, 
you can filter your browsers network logs to those containing your client SDK key.

In Chrome, going to the `Network` tab of the developer tools and filtering to 'client-' is enough to show all the requests:

![network-logs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a2b1672-a86f-429d-aa4b-b8c8a578eeae)


### Check Evaluation Reason

When you get a value that you don't fully understand, you can check the `details` field to see how that value was received.

For example, if you have a feature gate, you can check the `.details.reason` field:
```ts
const gate = myStatsigClient.getFeatureGate('a_gate');
console.log(gate.details.reason); // <- Prints the reason for this evaluation
```

Reasons can be any of the following:
- `Network` | `NetworkNotModified` - The latest value from a network requests
- `Cache` - Values loaded from local storage
- `NoValues` - No cache and no successful network request
- `Bootstrap` - Values found and loaded after a `dataAdapter.setData` call
- `Prefetch` - Values found and loaded after a `dataAdapter.prefetchData` call

`FeatureGate`, `DynamicConfig`, `Experiment` and `Layer` types all have this `details` object. (Learn more at [Debugging > Reasons](/sdk/debugging#reasons))
