## Multiple Client Instances

In some cases, it might be useful to have multiple instances of the Statsig client running.

🔥IMPORTANT: You must use **two different SDK keys** for this to work. Various functionality of the Statsig client is keyed on the SDK key being used. Using the same key will lead to collisions.
