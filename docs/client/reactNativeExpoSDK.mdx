Statsig client side SDK for applications in React Native using Expo. If you are not using Expo, check out our plain [React Native SDK](./reactNativeSDK). This SDK is based on our [JavaScript client SDK](https://github.com/statsig-io/js-client).

## Installation {#installation}

You can install the SDK via npm or yarn. In your project directory, run:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    {label: 'NPM', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install statsig-react-native-expo
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add statsig-react-native-expo
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next you can import Statsig in your code and use it away!

```jsx
import Statsig from "statsig-react-native-expo";
```

## Usage {#usage}

### v3.X.X+

v3.X.X of our react-native-expo SDK wraps the [statsig-react](./reactSDK) sdk. It contains the same React Context, Providers, and Hooks, used in the same way. Get started with our [suggested usage](./reactSDK#usage) or the [Provider and Hooks](/client/reactSDK#more-details) details.

### Older versions

Because our React Native Expo SDK is based on our [JavaScript client SDK](/client/jsClientSDK), you can use them exactly the same way. Check out the [usage guide](./jsClientSDK#step-3---initialize-the-sdk) to learn about how to initialize Statsig and use Feature Gates or Dynamic Configs.
