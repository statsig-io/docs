### Updating Users

At some point, your user might need to change. To make Statsig aware of this new user, you will need to make
a call to an UpdateUser function.

```csharp
client.UpdateUserSync(user);

// or, use the shared instance

StatsigClient::Shared().UpdateUserSync(user);
```

If you want to ensure you have the latest values for an update (Say you are transition from 
logged out to logged in). You can use the Asynchronous update function.

```csharp
{client or StatsigClient::Shared()}.UpdateUserAsync(
    user,
    [](StatsigResultCode result) {
        if (result == StatsigResultCode::Ok) {
          // do something now that the latest values have been fetched
        } else {
          // error state
        }
    }
);
```

Asynchronous vs Synchronous behaviors are the same as the [Initialize](#initialize-the-sdk) functions.
