Statsig client side SDK for applications in React Native not using Expo. If you are using Expo, check out our [Expo SDK](./reactNativeExpoSDK). This SDK is based on our [JavaScript client SDK](https://github.com/statsig-io/js-client).

## Installation {#installation}

You can install the SDK via npm or yarn. In your project directory, run:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    {label: 'NPM', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install statsig-react-native
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add statsig-react-native
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, let's install the dependencies we need for the SDK to work:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    {label: 'NPM', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-device-info react-native-get-random-values
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-device-info react-native-get-random-values
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Lastly, if you are on a Mac and developing for iOS, you need to install the pods to complete the linking:

```shell
npx pod-install ios # or pod install, in your /ios folder
```

#### Usage

How we at Statsig use the SDK, and suggested usage.

:::info
NOTE: The `statsig-react-native` SDK wraps the [statsig-react](./reactSDK)  SDK.  It contains the same React Context, Providers, and Hooks, used in the same way, HOWEVER you must import from the `statsig-react-native` package.
:::

It also exposes a global `Statsig` class that you can import outside your component tree to check gates/log events/etc.

At the root of your component tree, wrap your app in a `StatsigProvider` and set `waitForInitialization=true` (if you do not wait for initialization, `useGate` hooks will return false on the first render, and will only update to the actual gate value once SDK initialization completes and Gates are fetched for the passed in user.  Similarly, `useConfig` and `useExperiment` will return empty dynamic configs).


```react

import { StatsigProvider } from 'statsig-react-native';

...

<StatsigProvider
    sdkKey="<CLIENT_SDK_KEY>"
    user={{
      userID: <LOGGED_IN_USER_ID>,
      email: session?.user?.email ?? undefined,
      ... // other user parameters
    }}
    waitForInitialization={true}>
    <MyComponent />
</StatsigProvider>
```

Then, in your app, the `useGate`, `useConfig`, and `useExperiment` hooks will provide the up to date values of Feature Gates, DynamicConfigs, and Experiments (respectively) for the initialized user.  If you are unfamiliar with React Hooks, see the [rules of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html).

```react
import { useGate } from 'statsig-react-native';

...

export default function MyComponent(): JSX.Element {
  // only call hooks at the top level of a functional component
  const featureOn = useGate(<MY_FEATURE_GATE>).value;

  return {featureOn ? <MyComponent /> : null;
}
```

:::info
NOTE: Statsig SDK Hooks rely on a Context from the Statsig Provider.  Context will get its value from the closest matching Provider above it in the component tree. Make sure you make a separate child component to consume the StatsigContext, and place your hooks there. Learn more here: https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html
:::

To logEvents, get the global javascript SDK

```react
import { Statsig } from 'statsig-react-native';

...

export default function MyComponent(): JSX.Element {

  return
    <Button
      onClick={() => {
        Statsig.logEvent('button_clicked');
      }}
    />;
}
```

If you need to check gates/configs in a loop, you can use this same import to avoid using the Feature Gate and Config hooks improperly in a loop.


#### More Details

The `statsig-react-native` sdk exports the following components:

##### `StatsigProvider`
StatsigProvider is a [react context provider](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextprovider) which initializes the SDK, and passes down its state to the rest of the react application via a `StatsigContext`.  It takes the following properties:

- `children: React.ReactNode | React.ReactNode[];` - One or more child components
- `sdkKey: string;` - A client SDK key from the Statsig Console
- `user: StatsigUser;` - A [Statsig User](/client/concepts/user) object.  Changing this will update the user and Gate values, causing a re-initialization
- `options?: StatsigOptions;` - See [StatsigOptions](/client/jsClientSDK#statsig-options).  An optional bag of initialization properties (shared with the statsig-js sdk) for advanced configuration.  
- `waitForInitialization?: boolean;` - Waits for the SDK to initialize with updated values before rendering child components
- `initializingComponent?: React.ReactNode | React.ReactNode[];` - A loading component to render iff waitForInitialization is set to true and the SDK is initializing
- `mountKey?: string` - A key for stable mounting/unmounting when updating the user.  If this key is set and changes when the user object changes (or if it is not provided) Then the children of StatsigProvider will unmount/remount with the async update. If this key is set and does not change, then the children of StatsigProvider will continue to be mounted, and it will trigger a rerender after updateUser completes.
- `shutdownOnUnmount?: boolean` - If set to true, will automatically call Statsig.shutdown() when the provider is unmounted

#### Hooks
The SDK exposes Feature Gates, Dynamic Configs, Experiments, and the underlying [statsig-js](/client/jsClientSDK).  If you are unfamiliar with hooks, be sure to check out the [rules of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html)

##### `useGate`
A react hook to get a Statsig Feature Gate.

Parameters:
- `gateName: string` - the name of the gate to check

Returns `GateResult`:
-   `isLoading: boolean;` - the loading/initializing state of the SDK
-   `value: boolean` - the value of the feature gate (false by default)

##### `useConfig`
A react hook to get a Statsig Dynamic Config.

Parameters:
- `configName: string` - the name of the config to get


Returns `ConfigResult`:
-   `isLoading: boolean;` - the loading/initializing state of the SDK
-   `config: DynamicConfig` - the backing `DynamicConfig` (see the [statsig-js sdk docs](/client/jsClientSDK) for more information)

##### `useExperiment`
A react hook to get a Statsig Experiment, represented as a DynamicConfig.

Parameters:
- `experimentName: string` - the name of the experiment to get


Returns `ConfigResult`:
-   `isLoading: boolean;` - the loading/initializing state of the SDK
-   `config: DynamicConfig` - the backing `DynamicConfig` (see the [statsig-js sdk docs](/client/jsClientSDK) for more information)

##### `useLayer`
A react hook to get a Statsig Experiment, represented as a DynamicConfig.

Parameters:
- `experimentName: string` - the name of the experiment to get

Returns `LayerResult`:
-   `isLoading: boolean;` - the loading/initializing state of the SDK
-   `layer: Layer` - the backing `Layer` (see the [statsig-js sdk docs](/client/jsClientSDK) for more information)


##### `useStatsigLogEffect`
A react hook to simplify top level logEvents into an effect which will only log and event once the SDK is ready

Parameters: none
- `eventName: string`
- `value?: string | number | null`
- `metadata?: Record<string, string> | null`


##### `StatsigContext`
StatsigContext is a [react context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) used internally by the SDK to manage internal state.  You should not need to use the `StatsigContext` directly, as the Provider and Hooks interface with it for you.  It tracks the following state:

- `initialized: boolean;` the initialization state of the SDK
- `statsigPromise: React.MutableRefObject<Promise<void>> | null;` a reference to a promise which resolves once SDK initialization is complete
- `initStarted: boolean` whether the singleton `Statsig` has had `initialize` called on it, meaning the SDK is now usable and can serve checks from cache and queue log events
- `userVersion: number` used interally by the SDK to memoize SDK functions based on the user. Increments when the user object is changed and updateUser is called.

##### `Statsig`
You can import the global `Statsig` singleton to call SDK functions outside of a component tree or in callbacks/loops/or wherever else you are unable to use hooks.  For all SDK functions, see the [statsig-js sdk docs](/client/jsClientSDK).

:::info
If you are calling methods on the global `Statsig` like `initialize` or `updateUser`, the user object tracked by the provider and the user object used outside the component tree can get out of sync.  You are responsible for maintaining the state of the `user` and keeping it consistent with the `StatsigProvider` in these cases.  The `statsig-react-native` SDK uses the global `Statsig` class to serve gate/config/experiment checks, but these are memoized in the hooks the SDK provides.  Updates to the user which impact flag values that are made outside the context of the react component tree will not be reflected in the component tree unless the updated user is passed in to the `StatsigProvider`.

```jsx
import { Statsig } from "statsig-react-native";

...

Statsig.checkGate("gate_name");
```

### FAQ

Some users of the react native SDK have reported issues that look like the following:

```
 ERROR  [Statsig] An unexpected exception occurred. [TypeError: undefined is not a function (near '...}).finally(function () {...')]
```

Some libraries, like storybook, remove the `finally()` handler for promises.  In order to pollyfill this and get around the error, see this thread:
