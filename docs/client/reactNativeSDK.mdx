Statsig client side SDK for applications in React Native not using Expo. If you are using Expo, check out our [Expo SDK](./reactNativeExpoSDK). This SDK is based on our [JavaScript client SDK](https://github.com/statsig-io/js-client).

## Installation {#installation}

You can install the SDK via npm or yarn. In your project directory, run:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    {label: 'NPM', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install statsig-react-native
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add statsig-react-native
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, let's install the dependencies we need for the SDK to work:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    {label: 'NPM', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-device-info react-native-get-random-values
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-device-info react-native-get-random-values
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Lastly, if you are on a Mac and developing for iOS, you need to install the pods to complete the linking:

```shell
npx pod-install ios # or pod install, in your /ios folder
```

## Usage {#usage}

### v3.0.2+
v3.X.X of our react-native-expo SDK wraps the [statsig-react](./reactSDK) sdk.  It contains the same React Context, Providers, and Hooks, used in the same way.  Get started with our [suggested usage](./reactSDK#usage) or the [Provider and Hooks](/client/reactSDK#more-details) details.

### Older versions

Because our React Native SDK is based on our [JavaScript client SDK](/client/jsClientSDK), you can use them exactly the same way. Check out the [usage guide](./jsClientSDK#step-3---initialize-the-sdk) to learn about how to initialize Statsig and use Feature Gates or Dynamic Configs.
