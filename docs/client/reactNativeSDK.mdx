Statsig client side SDK for applications in React Native not using Expo. If you are using Expo, check out our [Expo SDK](./reactNativeExpoSDK). This SDK is based on our [JavaScript client SDK](https://github.com/statsig-io/js-client).

## Installation {#installation}

You can install the SDK via npm or yarn. In your project directory, run:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    {label: 'NPM', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install statsig-react-native
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add statsig-react-native
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, let's install the dependencies we need for the SDK to work:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    {label: 'NPM', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-device-info react-native-get-random-values
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-device-info react-native-get-random-values
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Lastly, if you are on a Mac and developing for iOS, you need to install the pods to complete the linking:

```shell
npx pod-install ios # or pod install, in your /ios folder
```

## Usage {#usage}


```jsx
import { StatsigProvider, useGate, useExperiment, useConfig, Statsig } from "statsig-react-native";
```

### v4.X.X+

v4.X.X of our react-native SDK wraps the [statsig-react](./reactSDK) sdk. It contains the same React Context, Providers, and Hooks, used in the same way. Get started with our [suggested usage](./reactSDK#usage) or the [Provider and Hooks](/client/reactSDK#more-details) details.

It also exposes a global `Statsig` class that you can import outside your component tree to check gates/log events/etc.

```jsx
import { Statsig } from "statsig-react-native";

...

Statsig.checkGate("gate_name");
```

### FAQ

Some users of the react native SDK have reported issues that look like the following:

```
 ERROR  [Statsig] An unexpected exception occurred. [TypeError: undefined is not a function (near '...}).finally(function () {...')]
```

Some libraries, like storybook, remove the `finally()` handler for promises.  In order to pollyfill this and get around the error, see this thread:
