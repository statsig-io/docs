`Initialize()` takes an optional parameter `options` in addition to `sdkKey` and `user` that you can provide to customize the Statsig client. Here are the current options and we are always adding more to the list:

- **environment**: StatsigEnvironment, default null
  - An object you can use to set environment variables that apply to all of your users in the same session and will be used for targeting purposes.
  - The most common usage is to set the environment tier (EnvironmentTier), e.g. `new StatsigEnvironment(EnvironmentTier.Staging)`, and have feature gates pass/fail for specific environments.
- **ClientRequestTimeoutMs**: int, default 0.

  - When set, the `/initialize` request will wait for a maximum of the specified ms before ignoring the request and considering the SDK initialized (relying on cached values or default values for checks to gates/experiments)

- **PersistentStorageFolder**: string, default null

  - use this to specify a location for the persistent storage where the SDK will save cached values and logs.

- **ClientRequestTimeoutMs**: int, default 0
  - use this to configure a timeout for the initialize request;
  - when the request times out, the SDK will serve cached or default values.
