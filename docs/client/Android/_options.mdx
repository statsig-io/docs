You can pass in an optional parameter `options` in addition to `sdkKey` and `user` during initialization to customize the Statsig client. Here are the current options and we are always adding more to the list:

1. **initTimeoutMs**: double, default 3000
   - used to decide how long the Statsig client waits for the initial network request to respond before calling the completion block. The Statsig client will return either cached values (if any) or default values if checkGate/getConfig/getExperiment is called before the initial network request completes.
   - if you always want to wait for the latest values fetched from Statsig server, you should set this to 0 so we do not timeout the network request.
   - unit is milliseconds.
2. **disableCurrentVCLogging**: boolean, default false
   - by default, any custom event your application logs with `Statsig.logEvent()` includes the current root View Controller. This is so we can generate user journey funnels for your users. You can set this parameter to true to disable this behavior.
3. **environment tier**: Tier (enum), default null
   - used to signal the environment tier the user is currently in, and can be PRODUCTION, STAGING or DEVELOPMENT;
   - e.g. passing in a value of `Tier.Staging` will allow your users to pass any condition that pass for the staging environment tier, and fail any condition that only passes for other environment tiers.
4. **enableAutoValueUpdate**: boolean, default false
   - by default, Statsig will only fetch the gates/configs for the user when initialize() is called. This ensures a consistent experience for the duration of a session.  If you want to override this behavior and have flags/configs update in near real time, pass `true` instead.
5. **overrideStableID**: string?, default null
   - overrides the `stableID` in the SDK that is set for the user

## Overrides

If you want to locally override gates/configs/experiments, there are a set of override APIs as follows.  Note that these only apply locally on the device where they are being tested - they do not update definitions in the Statsig console or elsewhere.

```
// Overrides the given gate to the specified value
overrideGate(gateName: String, value: Boolean)
```
```
// Overrides the given config (dynamic config or experiment) to the provided value
overrideConfig(configName: String, value: Map<String, Any>)
```
```
// Removes any overrides associated with the provided gate/config/experiment name
removeOverride(name: String)
```
```
// Removes all overrides
removeAllOverrides()
```
```
// Returns the set of gate and config overrides currently in place on the client
getAllOverrides(): StatsigOverrides

class StatsigOverrides(
    @SerializedName("gates")
    val gates: MutableMap<String, Boolean>,

    @SerializedName("configs")
    val configs: MutableMap<String, Map<String, Any>>
    )
{}
```

Note that these will be persisted to local storage on the device, so overrides will persist across sessions.  If you want to clear out the overrides, you can remove them all with `removeAllOverrides` or remove a specific override with `removeOverride`
