You can pass in an optional parameter `options` in addition to `sdkKey` and `user` during initialization to customize the Statsig client. Here are the current options and we are always adding more to the list:


- **api** - `String`, default https://api.statsig.com/v1/
  - The default endpoint to use for all SDK network requests. You should not override this (unless you have another API that implements the Statsig API endpoints)

- **disableCurrentActivityLogging**: `Boolean`, default `false`
  - by default, any custom event your application logs with `Statsig.logEvent()` includes the current top-level activity. This is so we can generate user journey funnels for your users. You can set this parameter to true to disable this behavior.

- **disableDiagnosticsLogging**: `Boolean`, default `false` **(Deprecated)**
  - Deprecated: This option is no longer available
  - Previously: Prevent the SDK from sending useful debug information to Statsig

- **initTimeoutMs**: `Long`, default `3000`
  - used to decide how long the Statsig client waits for the initial network request to respond before calling the completion block. The Statsig client will return either cached values (if any) or default values if checkGate/getConfig/getExperiment is called before the initial network request completes.
  - if you always want to wait for the latest values fetched from Statsig server, you should set this to 0 so we do not timeout the network request.
  - unit is milliseconds.

- **enableAutoValueUpdate**: `Boolean`, default `false`
  - By default, feature values for a user are fetched once during Statsig.start and don't change throughout the session. Setting this value to true will make Statsig periodically fetch updated values for the current user.

- **autoValueUpdateIntervalMinutes**: `Double`, default `1.0`
  - Only applies if enableAutoValueUpdate is true. Controls how frequently calls to refresh the current users values are made. Time is in minutes and defaults to 1 minute. Minimum value is 1 minute.

- **overrideStableID**: `String?`, default `null`
  - overrides the `stableID` in the SDK that is set for the user

- **loadCacheAsync**: `Boolean`, default `false`
  - Whether or not the SDK should block on loading saved values from disk.

- **initializeValues**: `Map<String, Any>?`, default `null`
  - Provide the `initialize response` values directly to the Android SDK to synchronously initialize the client or "Bootstrap". You can generate these values from a Statsig Server SDK like the [NodeJS Server SDK](/server/nodejsServerSDK#bootstrap) and pass them in to the SDK when initializing. For more info, see [Bootstraping.](/client/concepts/initialize/#2-bootstrap-initialization) 

- **disableHashing**: `Boolean?`, default `false`
  - When disabled, the SDK will not hash gate/config/experiment names, instead they will be readable as plain text.

   :::

- **customCacheKey**: `((sdkKey: String, user: StatsigUser) -> String)`, default: `{ sdkKey, user -> "${user.getCacheKey()}:$sdkKey" },` v4.26.0+
  - By default, client SDKs define a "user" for caching as the set of all IDs (the UserID and CustomIDs) and the sdkKey (so multiple instances don't collide)
  - This can mean that a different set of fields will map to the same cached user.  The intent is to improve cache hit rate, and provide better defaults
  - If you have critical fields that define a user differently which are not considered IDs, you can override the cache key we generate using this function

- **evaluationCallback**: `((config: BaseConfig) -> Unit)`, v4.24.0+
  - A function that can be supplied to the sdk that will be called whenever a gate, config, experiment or layer is checked. The function takes a BaseConfig, which will be one of FeatureGate, DynamicConfig, or Layer, as the only parameter which is the result of the check made.

#### Methods

- **setTier | setEnvironmentParameter | getEnvironment**
   - used to signal the environment tier the user is currently in. 
   - `setTier` can be PRODUCTION, STAGING or DEVELOPMENT. e.g. passing in a value of `Tier.STAGING` will allow your users to pass any condition that pass for the staging environment tier, and fail any condition that only passes for other environment tiers.
   - `setEnvironmentParameter` can be used for custom tiers, eg `options.setEnvironmentParameter("tier", "test")`

#### Runtime Options
Starting in `V4.43.0`, a subset of options can be set during initialization and later updated while the Statsig client is running.

These options are defined in `StatsigRuntimeMutableOptions` (which `StatsigOptions` extends) and are detailed below.

Call `Statsig.updateRuntimeOptions(runtimeMutableOptions: StatsigRuntimeMutableOptions)` or the corresponding method in `StatsigClient` to update the Statsig client with new values.

- **loggingEnabled**: `Boolean`, default `true`
   - Setting this value to `false` will prevent the Statsig client from sending logging events over the network or saving events to its on-disk cache. The 1000 most recent events will be queued in memory. They can be logged to network (or cached) if `loggingEnabled` is set to `true` later during that session.
   - Calling `Statsig.flush()` after setting `loggingEnabled` to `true` will immediately clear the queue and minimize loss of older log events
   - This can be useful for cases where it is necessary for users to grant permission before events should be logged, or in any other cases where logging should not be enabled
