`V4.37.1+` of the Android SDK is now published only to Maven Central.

see: https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.statsig/android-sdk

To install the SDK, set the Maven Central repository in your build.gradle. You probably already have this for other dependencies.

You can also install the SDK using JitPack for Version `<=V4.37.0`. See the latest version and installation steps at https://jitpack.io/#statsig-io/android-sdk.
