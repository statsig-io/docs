In `build.gradle` include the statsig dependency, directly from the github source (via jitpack).

In your root build.gradle, at the end of repositories, add:

    allprojects {
        repositories {
            ...
            maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        }
    }

Then, add the dependency:

    implementation 'com.github.statsig-io:android-sdk:v2.0.0'

Finally, run a gradle sync so Intellij/Android Studio recognizes the Statsig library.
