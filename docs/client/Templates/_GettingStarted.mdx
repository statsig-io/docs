## Initialize the SDK

After installation, you will need to initialize the SDK using a Client SDK key from the ["API Keys" tab on the Statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).

These Client SDK Keys are intended to be embedded in client side applications. If need be, you can invalidate or create new SDK Keys for other applications/SDK integrations.

:::info
Do NOT embed your Server Secret Key in client-side applications, or expose it in any external-facing documents. However, if you accidentally expose it, you can create a new one in the Statsig console.
:::

In addition to the SDK key, you should also pass in a [StatsigUser](#statsig-user) for feature gate targeting and experimentation grouping purposes.

{
  props.shouldSkipStatsigOptions !== true && <div>

The 3rd parameter is optional and allows you to pass in a [StatsigOptions](#statsig-options) to customize the SDK.

  </div>
}
