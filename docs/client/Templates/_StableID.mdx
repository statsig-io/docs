## stableID

Each client SDK has the notion of stableID, and identifier that is generated
the first time the SDK is initialized and is stored locally for all future sessions.
Unless storage is wiped (or app deleted), the stableID will not change.
This allows us to run device level experiments and experiments when other user identifiable information is unavailable (Logged out users).

:::note ID Mapping Limitations
When using stableID for experiments, note that Cloud deployments cannot map between stableID and other ID types (like userID) for analysis. For advanced ID mapping capabilities, see [ID Mapping Capabilities](/experiments-plus/create-new#id-mapping-capabilities) or consider Statsig Warehouse Native.
:::

You can get the stableID for the current device with:

<div>{props.getSnippet}</div>

If you have your own form of stableID and would prefer to use it instead of the Statsig generated ID, you can override it through StatsigOptions:

<div>{props.overrideSnippet}</div>
