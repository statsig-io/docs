## Getting Started

<span>
  The following will outline how to get up and running with Statsig for{" "}
  {props.sdkType}.

### Create an Account

To work with the SDK, you will need a Statsig account. If you don't yet have an account, go ahead and [sign up](https://console.statsig.com/sign_up) for a free account now.

You could skip this for now, but you will need an SDK key and some gates/experiments to use with the SDK in just a minute.

### Initialize the SDK

Initialize the SDK using a Client SDK key from the ["API Keys" tab on the Statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).  When creating the key, or using an existing key,
you will need to add the "Allow Download Config Specs" scope.  Client keys, by default, are not able to download the project definition to do local evaluation.  You must opt in
to allow your client key to access your full project definition on our cdn.

To add the scope to an existing key, under **Project Settings** >> **API Keys** >> **Client API Keys**, select **Actions** >> **Edit Scopes**, and "Allow Download Config Specs", then **Save**.

When creating a new client key, select "Allow Download Config Specs"

Do NOT embed your Server Secret Key in client side applications.

In addition to the SDK key, you should also pass in a [StatsigUser](#statsig-user) for feature gate targeting and experimentation grouping purposes.

<!-- The terrible formatting below is to ensure the markdown works -->

  props.shouldSkipStatsigOptions !== true && <div>

The 3rd parameter is optional and allows you to pass in a [StatsigOptions](#statsig-options) to customize the SDK.

  </div>
