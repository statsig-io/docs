## Initialize Response {#initialize-response}

The Statsig SDK provides a method to access the raw values that are used internally to provide gate, config, and layer results. This can be useful for debugging or for advanced use cases where you need to access the underlying data.

<div>{props.getInitializeResponseJson}</div>

The `getInitializeResponseJson` method returns an `ExternalInitializeResponse` object that contains:

1. A JSON string representation of the initialize response values
2. Evaluation details that provide metadata about how the values were obtained (network, cache, etc.)

This method is available in SDK version:
- Android: All versions
- iOS: All versions
