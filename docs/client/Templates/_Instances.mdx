## Using multiple instances of the SDK

Our documentation up to this point guides you through setting up your Statsig integration via the singleton Statsig.

There are cases where you may need to create multiple instances of the Statsig SDK.  Each SDK supports this as well - the `Statsig` singleton wraps a single instance of the SDK (typically called a `StatsigClient`) that you can instantiate.

ðŸ”¥IMPORTANT: You must use a different SDK key for each sdk instance you create for this to work. Various functionality of the Statsig client is keyed on the SDK key being used. Using the same key will lead to collisions.

All top level static methods from the singleton carry over as instance methods.  To create an instance of the Statsig sdk:

<div>
{props.example} 
</div>
