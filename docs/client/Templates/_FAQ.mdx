## FAQ {#faq}

#### How do I run experiments for logged out users? {#logged-out-experiments}

See the guide on [device level experiments](/guides/first-device-level-experiment)

#### Is the SDK thread safe (for multi-threaded languages)? {#thread-safety}

Even though we try to make the SDK thread safe whenever we can, we make no guarantees that is always the case.
Therefore, please make sure to always call Statsig APIs from the same thread.
