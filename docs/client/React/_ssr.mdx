## Server Side Rendering {#ssr}

Starting in `v1.9.1`, the react SDK supports server side rendering via the `StatsigSynchronousProvider`.
This provider takes in similar properties to the `StatsigProvider` with a few exceptions:

- the addition of an `initializeValues` prop, which takes in the `initializeValues` generated by a
  Statsig Server SDK that supports [`Client SDK Bootstrapping`](https://docs.statsig.com/search?q=Client+SDK+Bootstrapping). Normally, client SDKs fetch this value by hitting the `/initialize` endpoint

- consequently, there is no `waitForInitialization` or `initializingComponent` as the SDK is initialized and
  has all of the values immediately when rendered on the server (or on the first render pass on the client).

Note that if the user object changes, the provider will update the user and values via a call to Statsig servers.

:::warning
Pick a *single* provider to wrap your app - don't return the `StatsigSynchronousProvider` when executing on the server, and swap it out with the `StatsigProvider` when rendered on the client (or vice versa).  Pick one provider for your use case and only render that
