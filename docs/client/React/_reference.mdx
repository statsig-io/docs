### `Statsig` {#statsig-interface}

You can import the global `Statsig` singleton to call SDK functions outside of a component tree or in callbacks/loops/or wherever else you are unable to use hooks. For all SDK functions, see the [statsig-js sdk docs](/client/deprecated/jsClientSDK).

:::caution
If you are calling methods on the global `Statsig` like `initialize` or `updateUser`, the user object tracked by the provider and the user object used outside the component tree can get out of sync. You are responsible for maintaining the state of the `user` and keeping it consistent with the `StatsigProvider` in these cases. The `statsig-react` SDK uses the global `Statsig` class to serve gate/config/experiment checks, but these are memoized in the hooks the SDK provides. Updates to the user which impact flag values that are made outside the context of the react component tree will not be reflected in the component tree unless the updated user is passed in to the `StatsigProvider`.
:::

Due to the above limitation, the main use case for using the singleton `Statsig` class is typically event logging.

```
static logEvent(eventName: string, value: string | number | null = null, metadata: Record<string, string> | null = null): void
```
Logs a custom event with optional value and metadata.  Note that prior to v1.38.0, this method could throw if you did not specify to `waitForInitialization` or `waitForCache` if the method was called prior to the sdk initialization (which would happen on the first render path).  To avoid this, you should check the `const { initStarted } = useContext(StatsigContext);` field of the `StatsigContext` and only log events after `initStarted` is true.

Parameters:
`eventName`: The name of the event to log.
`value`: An optional value associated with the event.
`metadata`: Optional metadata for the event as a record of key-value pairs.

```
static checkGate(gateName: string, ignoreOverrides = false): boolean
```
Checks the status of a feature gate for the current user.

Parameters:
`gateName`: The name of the feature gate to check.
`ignoreOverrides`: Whether to ignore any local overrides for this gate.
Returns: true if the gate is open for the user, false otherwise.

```
static getConfig(configName: string, ignoreOverrides = false): DynamicConfig
```
Retrieves a dynamic configuration by name.

Parameters:
`configName`: The name of the dynamic config to retrieve.
`ignoreOverrides`: Whether to ignore any local overrides for this config.
Returns: A `DynamicConfig` object representing the retrieved configuration.

```
static getExperiment(experimentName: string, keepDeviceValue = false, ignoreOverrides = false): DynamicConfig
```
Retrieves an experiment configuration by name.

Parameters:
`experimentName`: The name of the experiment to retrieve.
`keepDeviceValue`: optional. Whether to keep the value constant for the device, even as the user may fall out of targeting criteria or allocation percentages
`ignoreOverrides`: Whether to ignore any local overrides for this experiment.

### `StatsigProvider` {#statsig-provider}

The StatsigProvider is a [react context provider](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextprovider) which initializes the SDK, and passes down its state to the rest of the react application via a `StatsigContext`. It takes the following properties:

- `children: React.ReactNode | React.ReactNode[]` - One or more child components
- `sdkKey: string` - A client SDK key from the Statsig Console
- `user: StatsigUser` - A [StatsigUser](/client/concepts/user) object. Changing this will update the experiment and gate values, causing a re-initialization and rerender
- `options?: StatsigOptions` - See [StatsigOptions](/client/deprecated/reactSDK#statsig-options). An optional bag of initialization properties (mostly shared with the statsig-js sdk) for advanced configuration.
- `waitForInitialization?: boolean` -
- `initializingComponent?: React.ReactNode | React.ReactNode[]` - A loading component to render if and only if `waitForInitialization` is set to `true` and the SDK is initializing
- `mountKey?: string` - A key for stable mounting/unmounting when updating the user. If this key is set and changes when the user object changes (or if it is not provided) Then the children of StatsigProvider will unmount/remount with the async update. If this key is set and does not change, then the children of StatsigProvider will continue to be mounted, and it will trigger a rerender after updateUser completes.
- `shutdownOnUnmount?: boolean` - If set to true, will automatically call Statsig.shutdown() when the provider is unmounted

### `StatsigSynchronousProvider`

The StatsigSynchronousProvider is a altered version of the `StatsigProvider`, made specifically for [Server Side Rendering](#ssr) but can
also be leveraged for apps that do not require loading states.

- `children: React.ReactNode | React.ReactNode[]` - One or more child components
- `sdkKey: string` - A client SDK key from the Statsig Console
- `user: StatsigUser` - A [StatsigUser](/client/concepts/user) object. Changing this will update the experiment and gate values, causing a re-initialization and rerender
- `options?: StatsigOptions` - See [StatsigOptions](/client/deprecated/reactSDK#statsig-options). An optional bag of initialization properties (mostly shared with the statsig-js sdk) for advanced configuration.
- `initializeValues: Record<string, unknown>` - JSON object, generated by a Statsig Server SDK. See [Server Side Rendering](#ssr).

### `StatsigContext`

StatsigContext is a [react context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) used internally by the SDK to manage internal state. You should not need to use the `StatsigContext` directly, as the Provider and Hooks interface with it for you. It tracks the following state:

- `initialized: boolean;` the initialization state of the SDK
- `statsigPromise: React.MutableRefObject<Promise<void>> | null;` a reference to a promise which resolves once SDK initialization is complete
- `initStarted: boolean` whether the singleton `Statsig` has had `initialize` called on it, meaning the SDK is now usable and can serve checks from cache and queue log events
- `userVersion: number` used internally by the SDK to memoize SDK functions based on the user. Increments when the user object is changed and updateUser is called.

### `StatsigOptions` {#statsig-options}

- **environment**: StatsigEnvironment, default null
  - An object you can use to set environment variables that apply to all of your users in the same session and will be used for targeting purposes.
  - The most common usage is to set the environment tier ('production', 'staging' or 'development'), e.g. `{ tier: 'staging' }`, and have feature gates pass/fail for specific environments.
- **disableCurrentPageLogging** boolean, default false.
  - By default, the sdk appends the current page for log events to the event payload to generate user journey/funnel analytics
- **loggingIntervalMillis**: number, default 5000 (5s), min 1000, max 60000
  - How frequently to flush logs to statsig (milliseconds)
- **loggingBufferMaxSize**: number, default 10), min 2, max 500
  - Maximum number of events to buffer before flushing events to statsig
- **disableNetworkKeepalive**: boolean, default false
  - Entirely disables the keepalive flag from being appended to network requests issued by the SDK
- **api** - default https://api.statsig.com/v1/
  - The default endpoint to use for all SDK network requests. You should not override this (unless you have another API that implements the Statsig API endpoints)
  - If you wish to separately override the log_event endpoint only, see `eventLoggingApi`
- **overrideStableID** - string, default null
  - If you'd like to use your own ID in place of Statsig's stableID, then you can pass the ID as an option here.
  - Once a value is passed, the SDK will store this ID in the local storage for the browser for future use as well.
- **localMode** - boolean, default false
    - <LocalModeSnippet type="client" />
- **initTimeoutMs** - number, default 3000
  - This option configures the maximum time (in milliseconds) the SDK would wait for the network request made by `initialize()` to respond before it resolves.
  - If the SDK resolves before the network request has completed due to the timeout, it will continue work with local overrides, cached values, and then default values set in code.
- **disableErrorLogging** - boolean, default false
  - By default, the SDK auto logs javascript errors to Statsig. This will be connected with the metrics and pulse views to show the impact of new features on key error metrics
- **disableAutoMetricsLogging** - boolean, default false
  - By default, the SDK auto logs javascript performance metrics to Statsig. This will be connected with the metrics and pulse views to show the impact of new features on key performance metrics
- **eventLoggingApi?** `string`, default `'https://events.statsigapi.net/v1/`
  - The SDK will hit different endpoints for `initialize` to evaluate gates and for `logEvent` to log event data. The `api` option controls the evaluation endpoint, and `eventLoggingApi` controls the event logging endpoint.
- **prefetchUsers?** `StatsigUser[]` | null, default null
  - An array of additional StatsigUser objects to be fetched during the `statsig.initialize` call. A max of 5 users is enforced, if more than 5 users are provided, the 5 users at the start of the array will be used.
- **fetchMode?** `network-only | cache-or-network`, default `network-only`
  - Changes the behavior of updateUser calls. See [Fetch Mode](#fetch-mode-) for more details.
- **initCompletionCallback?** `(initDurationMs: number, success: boolean, message: string | null) => void`, default null
  - A callback that's invoked whenever initialization has completed.
- **updateUserCompletionCallback?** `(durationMs: number, success: boolean, message: string | null) => void`, default null
  - A callback that's invoked whenever an updateUser call has completed.
