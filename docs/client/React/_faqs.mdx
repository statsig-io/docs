#### Which Browsers Supported?

The `statsig-react` SDK relies on the `statsig-js` SDK and inherits its browser compatibility. For more information, see the [statsig-js docs](/client/deprecated/jsClientSDK#what-kind-of-browser-support-can-i-expect-from-the-sdk).

#### How do I silence "Call and wait for initialize() to finish first" logs?

Starting in `v1.6.0`, setting the environment variable `REACT_APP_STATSIG_SDK_MODE=silent` will swallow the `Call and wait for initialize() to finish first` exception. For more information, see the [release notes for v1.6.0](https://github.com/statsig-io/react-sdk/releases/tag/v1.6.0)

#### Can I write my own StatsigProvider?

import Gist from "react-gist";

If you wish to use the React SDK but customize the initialization logic beyond what the `StatsigProvider` offers, you can write your own provider. See the above warning on using the global `Statsig` singleton before proceeding.

An example provider with custom initialization logic might look something like this:

<Gist id="0bb12b2eb847847af62d547731d2dca9" />
