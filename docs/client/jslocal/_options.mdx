`statsig.initializeAsync()` and `statsig.initialize()` takes an optional parameter `options` in addition to `sdkKey` and `user` that you can provide to customize the Statsig client. Here are the current options and we are always adding more to the list:

### User properties
- **environment**: StatsigEnvironment, default null
  - An object you can use to set environment variables that apply to all of your users in the same session and will be used for targeting purposes.
  - The most common usage is to set the environment tier ('production', 'staging' or 'development'), e.g. `{ tier: 'staging' }`, and have feature gates pass/fail for specific environments.
- **overrideStableID** - string, default null
  - If you'd like to use your own ID in place of Statsig's stableID, then you can pass the ID as an option here.
  - Once a value is passed, the SDK will store this ID in the local storage for the browser for future use as well.
  - The SDK will automatically add an entry in `customIDs` in the user object for the current `stableID`

### Endpoint Overrides
- **configSpecAPI** - default https://api.statsig.com/v1/
  - The endpoint to download the config spec definition for your project. You should likely not override this unless you are hosting your config spec on your own cdn.  Defaults to `https://api.statsigcdn.com/v1/download_config_specs/<client_key>.json`, used for async initialization
- **eventLoggingApi?** `string`, default `'https://events.statsigapi.net/v1/rgstr/`
  - The SDK will hit different endpoints for downloading config definitions to evaluate gates and for `rgstr|log_event` to log event data. `eventLoggingApi` controls the event logging endpoint.

### Event Logging Parameters
- **disableCurrentPageLogging** boolean, default false.
  - By default, the sdk appends the current page for log events to the event payload to generate user journey/funnel analytics
- **loggingIntervalMillis**: number, default 5000 (5s), min 1000, max 60000
  - How frequently to flush logs to statsig (milliseconds)
- **loggingBufferMaxSize**: number, default 10), min 2, max 500
  - Maximum number of events to buffer before flushing events to statsig

### Initialization
- **initializeValues?** `Record<string, any> | null`, default null
  - Provide the `download_config_specs` values directly to the Javascript SDK to synchronously initialize the client
  - You may wish to fetch this from the default `js` snippet we provide on our cdn.  See "Synchronous Initialization" for more details
  - Only used when calling `statsig.initialize()`
- **initTimeoutMs?** number, default `3000`
  - For asynchronous initialization, the time to wait for the project definition to be downloaded before falling back to cached or default values
  - Only used when calling `statsig.initializeAsync()`

### Networking and Local Storage
- **localMode** - boolean, default false
  - <LocalModeSnippet type="client" />
- **ignoreWindowUndefined?** `boolean`, default `false`
  - By default, the SDK will not issue network requests when the global `window` is undefined.  If you are trying to execute in a server environment for SSR, you may wish to override this.  A better approach would be to bootstrap the sdk from the server rather than issuing a network request, but this can be used to unblock testing
- **disableLocalStorage?** `boolean`, default `false`
  - Completely disable the use of local storage for the lifecycle of this `initialize` -> `shutdown`. The only access to local storage will be to clear out existing keys when statsig is `shutdown`
- **disableNetworkKeepalive**: boolean, default false. sdk
  - Entirely disables the keepalive flag from being appended to network requests issued by the SDK
- **userPersistentStorage?** UserPersistentStorageInterface, default null
  - A persistent storage adapter for running sticky experiments.
