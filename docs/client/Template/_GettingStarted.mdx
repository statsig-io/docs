## Getting Started

<span>
  The following will outline how to get up and running with Statsig for{" "}
  {props.sdkType}.

### Create an Account

To work with the SDK, you will need a Statsig account. If you don't yet have an account, go ahead and [sign up](https://console.statsig.com/sign_up) for a free account now.

You could skip this for now, but you will need an SDK key and some gates/experiments to use with the SDK in just a minute.

### Installation

<div>{props.install}</div>

### Initialize the SDK

After installation, you will need to initialize the SDK using a Client SDK key from the ["API Keys" tab on the Statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).

These Client SDK Keys are intended to be embedded in client side applications. If need be, you can invalidate or create new SDK Keys for other applications/SDK integrations.

:::info
Do NOT embed your Server Secret Key in client side applications

In addition to the SDK key, you should also pass in a [Statsig user](#statsig-user) for feature gate targeting and experimentation grouping purposes.

The 3rd parameter is optional and allows you to pass in a [StatsigOptions](#statsig-options) to customize the SDK.

<div>{props.initialize}</div>

### Working with the SDK

Now that your SDK is initialized, let's fetch a [**Feature Gate**](/feature-gates). Feature Gates can be used to create logic branches in code that can be rolled out to different users from the Statsig Console. Gates are always **CLOSED** or **OFF** (think `return false;`) by default.

<div>{props.checkGate}</div>

Feature Gates can be very useful for simple on/off switches, with optional but advanced user targeting. However, if you want to be able send a different set of values (strings, numbers, and etc.) to your clients based on specific user attributes, e.g. country, **Dynamic Configs** can help you with that. The API is very similar to Feature Gates, but you get an entire json object you can configure on the server and you can fetch typed parameters from it. For example:

<div>{props.getConfig}</div>

---

Then we have **Layers/Experiments**, which you can use to run A/B/n experiments. We offer two APIs, but we recommend the use of [layers](/layers) to enable quicker iterations with parameter reuse.

<div>{props.getExperiment}</div>

Now that you have a Feature Gate or an Experiment set up, you may want to track some custom events and see how your new features or different experiment groups affect these events. This is super easy with Statsig - simply call the Log Event API for the event, and you can additionally provide some value and/or an object of metadata to be logged together with the event:

<div>{props.logEvent}</div>
