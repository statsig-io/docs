## Local Overrides

If you want to locally override gates/configs/experiments/layers, there are a set of override APIs as follows. Note that these only apply locally on the device where they are being tested - they do not update definitions in the Statsig console or elsewhere.

Note that these will be persisted to local storage on the device, so overrides will persist across sessions. If you want to clear out the overrides, you can remove them all with `removeAllOverrides` or remove a specific override with `removeOverride`
