Parameter Stores are only available for Statsig Client SDKs.
:::

Parameter Stores provide a new way to organize and manage parameters in your web or mobile app via the Statsig console. They are now available for the Statsig JS, React, React Native, Android, iOS, and Dart SDKs.

## **What is a Parameter Store?**

Rather than thinking in terms of Statsig entities like Feature Gates, Experiments, Layers, or Dynamic Configs, Parameter Stores let you focus on **parameters**—the values in your app that need to be configurable remotely. 

Parameter Stores decouple your code from the configuration, much like Statsig Layers decouple your code from specific experiments. This level of abstraction allows you to run experiments, adjust gating, or change values on the fly—**without hardcoding experiment names** in your app. 

Each parameter can be remapped between Statsig entities (as long as the parameter type remains the same). These parameters will receive dynamic values depending on the `StatsigUser` the SDK is initialized with, and they can be updated anytime without requiring a mobile code change or waiting for your mobile release cycle.

## **How to Use Parameter Stores**

Here’s a suggested workflow:

1. **Create a Parameter Store**: 
   Set up a Parameter Store for your team or project. Parameter Stores are designed to hold related parameters in one object.

2. **Identify Server-Side Variables**:
   Consider which variables you want to control server-side rather than hardcoding them in your app. These could include:
   
   - A boolean parameter to control access to a new feature. Even if you're used to using Feature Gates for boolean feature management, start with a boolean parameter instead.
   - A string parameter for text resources that you may want to swap or experiment with.
   - A number parameter for inputs such as the number of onboarding steps, a list length to truncate, and more.

3. **Start with Static Values**: 
   Begin with a static value for each parameter (what you would have hardcoded in the app). Use this static value initially.

4. **Remap When Ready**: 
   Once your app is shipped and the feature is ready, remap the parameter to a Feature Gate, Experiment, Dynamic Config, or Layer. This allows you to test and target different variants.

5. **Update in Real-Time**: 
   After experimenting, you can update the static value or gate the feature for specific app versions. This can be done in real time across mobile apps that are already released.

## **Why Use Parameter Stores?**

If you’ve encountered this problem before, you’ll immediately recognize the power of Parameter Stores. For developers just starting with a Statsig SDK in their mobile apps, it’s beneficial to use Parameter Stores from the outset.

Parameter Stores are inspired by solutions like Facebook's Mobile Config, Uber's approach to experimentation, and Firebase Remote Config. These are used by leading mobile companies to:

- Move faster
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Experiment more freely

While the extra setup in the Statsig console may seem less convenient than creating a gate, it saves time later. Once your app version is shipped, Parameter Stores ensure that no Statsig entity values are hardcoded, giving you flexibility to update parameters without the need for a new release. This is particularly valuable for mobile apps, where app store release cycles create delays—unlike backends or websites, which can be updated quickly.

## **Supported SDK Versions**

Parameter Stores are available in the following SDKs:

- **Android SDK** v4.33.0+
- **iOS SDK** v1.45.0+
- **@statsig/js-client**, **@statsig/react-bindings**, **@statsig/react-native-bindings**, **@statsig/react-native-expo-bindings** v1.4.0+
