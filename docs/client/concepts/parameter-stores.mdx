### **Parameter Stores: Simplifying Your Mobile App Configuration Management**

As a developer, hardcoded configuration values in mobile apps can become a bottleneck. Whether you're tweaking onboarding flows, changing UI elements, or managing feature rollouts, constantly updating your codebase and waiting for release cycles isn't efficient. **Parameter Stores** offer a flexible, real-time approach to managing configurations directly through the Statsig Console.

---

### **What Exactly is a Parameter Store?**

Parameter Stores let you manage the parameters driving features in your app (boolean flags, text resources, numerical settings) without hardcoding them into your code. This allows you to dynamically adjust app behavior by decoupling configuration from code.

Unlike Feature Gates, Experiments, or Dynamic Configs tied to specific workflows, Parameter Stores offer the flexibility to define and manage parameters independently, which can be remapped to these features later.

---

### **How to Use Parameter Stores: A Practical Example**

Let’s say you want to implement a new onboarding flow, but only for users on the latest version of your app. Here’s how Parameter Stores help without needing constant code updates:

1. **Create a Boolean Parameter**

   In the Statsig Console, create a boolean parameter called `enable_new_onboarding` and set its default value to `false`. This will be your feature toggle.

2. **Use the Parameter in Your Code**

   Fetch the value of the parameter in your app using the Statsig SDK:

   ```java
   boolean newOnboardingEnabled = StatsigClient.getConfig("enable_new_onboarding").getBoolean("value", false);
   if (newOnboardingEnabled) showNewOnboardingFlow();
   else showOldOnboardingFlow();
   ```

   The app reacts dynamically based on whether the new onboarding flow is enabled, without hardcoding the condition.

3. **Map the Parameter to a Feature Gate**

   Once you're ready to roll out the new onboarding flow to a specific user segment, remap the `enable_new_onboarding` parameter to a Feature Gate that targets users on the latest version.

4. **Control Updates in Real-Time**

   When you're ready to release the new flow to more users, simply update the parameter in the Statsig Console—no need to release a new app version.

### **Best Practices for Using Parameter Stores**

- **Start Small**: Begin with a simple, non-critical feature like `show_promo_banner` and create a boolean parameter to control it remotely.
- **Experiment with Dynamic Configs**: Remap parameters to Dynamic Configs when you need real-time changes based on user behavior or app version.
- **Stay Organized**: Group related parameters (e.g., all settings for onboarding) into a single Parameter Store. This simplifies management as your app scales.

---

### **Code Example: Feature Toggle**

Here’s a quick example for Android:

```java
StatsigClient.initialize(context, "client-sdk-key", statsigUser, () -> {
    boolean featureEnabled = StatsigClient.getFeatureGate("enable_new_feature").isEnabled();
    if (featureEnabled) showNewFeature();
    else showOldFeature();
});
```

You can update the value of `enable_new_feature` directly in the Statsig Console, without touching your app’s code.

### **Key Benefits of Parameter Stores**

Parameter Stores simplify how you manage configurations, giving you flexibility and control without hardcoded values. Here’s how they streamline your workflow:

- **Avoid Hardcoding**: Centralize feature flags and configurations, making it easier to maintain and update.
- **Real-Time Adjustments**: Change parameters like feature toggles or UI text instantly from the console, without waiting for app releases or redeploying code.
- **Feature Rollouts**: Remotely toggle features for a limited set of users with boolean parameters, avoiding hardcoded flags.
- **Long-Term Flexibility for Mobile Apps**: While configuring Parameter Stores in the Statsig console may require slightly more effort compared to creating a gate, it offers significant long-term benefits. Once your app version is shipped, Parameter Stores ensure that you avoid hardcoding entity values, giving you the flexibility to update parameters remotely without needing a new release. This is especially valuable for mobile apps, where updates depend on app store release cycles, unlike backends or websites, which can be updated more quickly.
- **Safe Experimentation**: Remap parameters to Feature Gates, Experiments, or Dynamic Configs to test features without affecting your main codebase.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain control over configurations for both old and new app versions, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Content Updates**: Dynamically update text resources or messages with string parameters, eliminating the need for redeployment.
- **Config Adjustments**: Experiment with different values (e.g., list lengths, step counts) by updating the parameter in the console.
- **Faster Iteration**: Respond quickly to feedback or evolving requirements by updating configurations instantly.

### **Next Steps for Maximizing Parameter Stores**

Now that you understand how Parameter Stores work, here’s how you can take full advantage of them:

- **Scale Your Usage**: Start with simple implementations like feature toggles, and gradually use Parameter Stores for more advanced scenarios such as A/B testing or feature rollouts.
- **Integrate with Other Statsig Tools**: Parameter Stores work seamlessly with Feature Gates, Dynamic Configs, and Experiments. Combining these tools enables greater flexibility and control over your app's behavior.
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Use Statsig’s built-in analytics to track how parameter changes affect your app. Make real-time adjustments based on user feedback and experiment results.
