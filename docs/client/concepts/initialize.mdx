One of the first steps in using a Statsig client SDK is to call the asynchronous `initialize()` method in the SDK language of your choice.
If you're looking for synchronous initialization or server side rendering, skip down to the bottom

### General Flow
`initialize` will take an SDK key and `StatsigUser` object, as well as a set of options to parameterize the SDK.  The sdk will then do a few things:
1. Check local storage for cached values.  The SDK caches the previous evaluations locally so they are available on the next session without a successful network call
2. Create a cache a `STATSIG_STABLE_ID` for experimenting on `stableID` - e.g. for experimenting and stable evaluations across the logged out to logged in boundary, where there userID may go from undefined to known.
3. Set the SDK as initialized so checks won't throw - they will either return cached values or defaults.
4. Issue a network request to Statsig to get the latest values for all gates/experiments/configs/layers/autotunes for the given user.  If the project definition does not change from the most recent cached values, this request may succeed without returning new data.
5. Resolve the asynchronous `initialize` call.  If the request to the server failed, the SDK will have the cached values or return defaults for this session.


### Synchronous Initialization
If asynchronous initialization is not an option for your performance requirements, you can initialize the SDK synchronously - throughout the docs, we refer to how you can accomplish this as "Server Side Rendering."
The client SDK still needs to know the gate and experiment values for the given user at initialization time, but you can use a server SDK to generate those values, so when your first network roundtrip completes, you can initialize the statsig SDK synchronously rather than waiting for a network round trip to Statsig servers.
The server SDK will take in a user object and use its local evaluation to generate the same response that the `/initialize` network call would generate.

This integration requires a client sdk and a server SDK, so it is a bit more setup, but it will give you the most performant way to integrate Statsig in your website. We currently only support this on the web (js, react) and mobile (react native, expo, android, ios) SDKs.

## Bootstrapping Overview

Bootstrapping the Client SDKs is a pattern used to provide the precomputed user assignments directly to the SDK for initialization, rather than relying on the default SDK behavior of downloading the configurations over the network from Statsig servers. This approach is beneficial if you're looking to remove the network dependency on Statsig and consolidate the download of the payload into the initial load to reduce latency. 

### Technical details 

With this approach, your server will be responsible for serving the configuration payload to your client app on page load (for web implementations) or during app launch (for mobile implementations).

This architecture requires running a server SDK that supports the `getClientInitializeResponse` method. 
Your server SDK will maintain a fresh configuration in memory and when a request hits your route handler, you should call `getClientInitializeResponse(<user>)`, passing in a StatsigUser Object to generate the configuration object that gets passed to the client SDK for synchronous initialization.

#### Additional Considerations

* You should pass the same user object on both the server and client side.
* The `initializeValues` option should be an Object.
* This approach allows the client SDK to initialize synchronously.

## NodeJS example

_Server-side Node express.js route_
```js
app.get('/', async (req, res) => { 
  const userObj = { 
    userID: user.id
  }   
  const initializeValues = Statsig.getClientInitializeResponse(userObj, null, {hash: "djb2"});
  // render page.hbs using two variables
  res.render('page.hbs', {    
    initializeValues: JSON.stringify(initializeValues),
    userObj: JSON.stringify(userObj),
  });
});
```

_Client-side JS within page.hbs_
```js
// pass both the userObject and initializeValues payloads as Object.
// The triple curly-brace in handlebars will unescape the JSON string
const client = new StatsigClient('<CLIENT_SIDE_KEY>' userObj);
client.dataAdapter.setData(bootstrapObject, user);
client.initializeSync();
```
