title: StatsigUser Object
sidebar_label: StatsigUser Object

## Introduction

You should provide a StatsigUser object whenever possible when initializing the SDK, passing as much information as possible in order to take advantage of advanced gate and config conditions (like country or OS/browser level checks). Most of the time, the User ID field is needed in order to provide a consistent experience for a given user (see device-level experiments to understand how to correctly run experiments for logged-out users). If the user is logged out at the SDK init time, you can leave out the User ID field, and Statsig will use a stable device ID that the SDK creates and stores in the local storage for targeting purposes.

All of the User Attributes can be explicitly supplied to the User Object and some can be automatically inferred from a user's device or connection. Supplying a User Attribute will always override any inferred values.

## User Attributes

| User ID                  | ID representing a unique user. This ID will be used to guarantee consistency of targeting for Feature Gates and Experiments and will be used to evaluate experiment results.

### Have sensitive user PII data that should not be logged?

On the StatsigUser object, there is a field called privateAttributes, which is a simple object/dictionary that you can use to set private user attributes. Any attribute set in privateAttributes will only be used for evaluation/targeting, and removed from any logs before they are sent to Statsig server.

For example, if you have feature gates that should only pass for users with emails ending in "@statsig.com", but do not want to log your users' email addresses to Statsig, you can simply add the key-value pair { email: "my_user@statsig.com" } to privateAttributes on the user and that's it!

For more information, refer to the the [privateAttributes guide](/guides/private-attributes).
