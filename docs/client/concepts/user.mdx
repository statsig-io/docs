## Introduction

You should provide a StatsigUser object whenever possible when initializing the SDK, passing as much information as possible in order to take advantage of advanced gate and config conditions (like country or OS/browser level checks). Most of the time, the User ID field is needed in order to provide a consistent experience for a given user (see device-level experiments to understand how to correctly run experiments for logged-out users). If the user is logged out at the SDK init time, you can leave out the User ID field, and Statsig will use a stable device ID that the SDK creates and stores in the local storage for targeting purposes.

### Have sensitive user PII data that should not be logged?

On the StatsigUser object, there is a field called privateAttributes, which is a simple object/dictionary that you can use to set private user attributes. Any attribute set in privateAttributes will only be used for evaluation/targeting, and removed from any logs before they are sent to Statsig server.

For example, if you have feature gates that should only pass for users with emails ending in "@statsig.com", but do not want to log your users' email addresses to Statsig, you can simply add the key-value pair { email: "my_user@statsig.com" } to privateAttributes on the user and that's it!

For more information, refer to the the [privateAttributes guide](/guides/private-attributes).
