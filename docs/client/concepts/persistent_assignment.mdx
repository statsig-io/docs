Persistent assignment allows you to ensure that a user's variant stays consistent while an experiment is running, regardless of changes to allocation or targeting.

## Persistent Storage

The persistent storage adapter allows you to plug in your own storage solution that Statsig SDK uses to persist user assignments.
The user persistent storage interface consists of just a `load`/`loadAsync`, `save`, `delete` API for read/write operations.

:::info
Currently only supported in `Javascript`, `iOS` and `Android`
:::

### Persistent Storage Logic
- Providing a storage adapter on Statsig initialization will give the SDK access to read & write on your custom storage
- Providing user persisted values to `get_experiment` will inform the SDK to
  - **save** the evaluation of the current user **on first evaluation**
  - **load** the previously saved evaluation of a persisted user **on subsequent evaluations**
  - **delete** the previously saved evaluation of a persisted user if the experiment is no longer active
- Not providing user persisted values to `get_experiment` will **delete** a previously saved evaluation

### Example usage

```typescript
await statsig.initialize('client-key', {userPersistentStorage: new CustomStorageAdapter()});

const user = { userID: "123" };
const userPersistedValues = await statsig.loadUserPersistedValuesAsync(user, 'userID');

let experiment = statsig.getExperiment({userID: "123"}, 'the_allocated_experiment', { userPersistedValues: userPersistedValues });
console.log(experiment.getGroupName()) // 'Control'

experiment = statsig.getExperiment({userID: "unknown"}, 'the_allocated_experiment', { userPersistedValues: userPersistedValues });
console.log(experiment.getGroupName()) // 'Control'
```
