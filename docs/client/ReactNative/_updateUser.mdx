### Updating the StatsigUser

If/when the user object changes, the SDK will automatically fetch the updated values for the new user object -
if `waitForInitialization` is false, and no [mountKey](#mount-key) is set on the [StatsigProvider](#statsig-provider), this will trigger a
re-render for the new user with default values, followed by a render when the values have been updated.

```js
setUser({ userID: "another-user" });
```

There also exists am `updateUser` method on the [Statsig](#statsig-interface) interface, but calling this directly may lead to issues with the StatsigProvider.
