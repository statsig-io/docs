## Prefetch Users

If you have multiple user objects and wish to cut down on network calls, you may provide a prefetchUsers array as part of StatsigOptions during initialization.

<div>{props.config}</div>

You may also call the prefetchUsers method at any time after initialization.

<div>{props.methodCall}</div>

These users are evaluated on the Statsig server and the results are returned to the client.
Later, when calling updateUser, if the user has been prefetched, no network request will be executed.

| Note that the prefetchUsers array is limited to 5 users
:::info
The prefetchUsers array is limited to 5 users. If a larger array is given, only the first 5 users will be taken.
