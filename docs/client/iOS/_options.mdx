`Statsig.start()` takes an optional parameter `options` in addition to `sdkKey` and `user` that you can provide to customize the Statsig client. Here are the current options and we are always adding more to the list:

1. **initTimeout**: double, default 3.0
   - used to decide how long the Statsig client waits for the initial network request to respond before calling the completion block. The Statsig client will return either cached values (if any) or default values if checkGate/getConfig/getExperiment is called before the initial network request completes.
   - If you always want to wait for the latest values fetched from Statsig server, you should set this to 0 so we do not timeout the network request.
2. **disableCurrentVCLogging**: boolean, default false
   - by default, any custom event your application logs with `Statsig.logEvent()` includes the current root View Controller. This is so we can generate user journey funnels for your users. You can set this parameter to true to disable this behavior.
3. **environment**: StatsigEnvironment, default nil
   - StatsigEnvironment is a class for you to set environment variables that apply to all of your users in the same session and will be used for targeting purposes.
   - e.g. passing in a value of `StatsigEnvironment(tier: .Staging)` will allow your users to pass any condition that pass for the staging environment tier, and fail any condition that only passes for other environment tiers.
4. **enableAutoValueUpdate**: boolean, default false
   - by default, feature values for a user is fetched once during `Statsig.start` and don't change throughout the session. Setting this value to true will turn on the feature for Statsig to periodically fetch updated values for the current user.
