## Using Persistent Evaluations

If you want to ensure that a user's variant stays consistent while an experiment is running, regardless of changes to allocation or targeting, you can use persistent storage. The iOS SDK supports a minimal implementation using the keepDeviceValues flag, see the [Client Persistent Assignment Doc](/client/concepts/persistent_assignment#support-in-ios-and-android-sdks) for more info.
