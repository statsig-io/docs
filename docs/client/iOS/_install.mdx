To install the SDK in your project, you can add Statsig as a dependency through Swift Package Manager: in your Xcode, select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency
and enter the URL https://github.com/statsig-io/ios-sdk.git.

You can also include it directly in your project's Package.swift. Find out the latest release version on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/statsig-io/ios-sdk/releases).

```
//...
dependencies: [
    // see the latest version on https://github.com/statsig-io/ios-sdk/releases
    .package(url: "https://github.com/statsig-io/ios-sdk.git", .upToNextMinor("1.5.0")),
],
//...
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YOUR_TARGET",
        dependencies: ["Statsig"]
    )
],
//...
```

If you are using CocoaPods, our pod name is 'Statsig', and you can include the following line to your Podfile:

```
use_frameworks!
target 'TargetName' do
  //...
  pod 'Statsig', '~> 1.5.0' // Add this line, see the latest version on https://github.com/statsig-io/ios-sdk/releases
end
```
