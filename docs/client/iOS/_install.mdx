You can also add Statsig as a dependency through Swift Package Manager, in your Xcode, select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency
and enter the URL https://github.com/statsig-io/ios-sdk.git.

You can also include it directly in your project's Package.swift:

```
//...
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/statsig-io/ios-sdk.git", .upToNextMinor("1.4.1")),
],
//...
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YOUR_TARGET",
        dependencies: ["Statsig"]
    )
],
//...
```

If you are using CocoaPods, our pod name is 'Statsig', and you can include the following line to your Podfile:

```
use_frameworks!
target 'TargetName' do
  //...
  pod 'Statsig', '~> 1.4.1' // Add this line
end
```
