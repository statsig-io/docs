Statsig client SDKs enable you to run experiments for user experience improvements in applications running on end-user devices. These applications include web and mobile apps, television and gaming apps, and other consumer electronics apps.  

As shown in the diagram below, implementing an experiment using a Statsig client SDK consists of three phases:
1. Initialization
2. Evaluating Experiment Variants
3. Recording Exposure & Custom Events

### 1. Initialization

- The client SDK `initialize` call takes the **client SDK key** and a [**StatsigUser**](/client/concepts/user) object and makes a network request to the Statsig servers; this network call fetches precomputed experiment parameters for the specified user from Statsig servers and stores these parameters in local storage on the client device

-	Statsig's server latency for this `initialize` call is generally less than 100ms; the latency for a given end-user may vary depending on how far they are from Statsig's servers; the client SDK has a built-in timeout of 3 seconds that you can configure using **StatsigOptions** when you initialize the SDK

-	The [**StatsigUser**](/client/concepts/user) object that you provide in the `initialize` call should include the user identifier (userID) that you use to identify the end-user of your application; the client SDK also generates a device identifier called _stableID_ to enable experiments where users arenâ€™t signed in and a _userID_ is not available; you can choose to override this _stableID_ through **StatsigOptions** using the _overrideStableID_ parameter when you initialize the SDK

### 2. Evaluating Experiment Variants

 - The client SDK `getExperiment` call synchronously returns the experiment configuration for the variant that your end-user is assigned to (you define these parameters when you set up an experiment on the Statsig console);  use the returned `config` to `get` the value of the parameters that you need to implement the test variant
 - If your experiment is part of a Layer, the `getLayer` call returns the experiment configuration for the variant that the your end-user is assigned to;  use the returned `config` to `get` the value of the parameters that you need to implement the test variant
 - The `checkGate` calls returns _true_ if the end-user passes the feature gate rules that you've configured on the Statsig console, and _false_ otherwise 
 - The `getConfig` call returns the dynamic configuration based on the rules that you've configured for your end-users; use the returned `config` to `get` the value of the parameters that you need to implement a dynamically configured app experience

 Statsig recommends including a default value when you make the `get` call to fetch a parameter value from the returned `config` object in case the parameter has not been configured in an experiment, layer, or dynamic config. Statsig automatically defaults to _false_ when you check a gate that has not been configured.   
 

### 3. Recording Exposure Events & Custom Events

-	The client SDK automatically flushes events to the Statsig servers every 10 seconds; you can also force this flush by calling `shutdown` to flush exposure events and custom events to Statsig servers. You can verify that these exposure events are being recorded in Statsig servers using the live **Exposure Stream** in the Statsig console under the **Diagnostics** tab of your experiment
-	The **Users** and **Checks** charts in the **Diagnostics** tab are updated hourly. Experiment **Results** with the **Metrics Lift** panel is updated daily around 9am PST.
