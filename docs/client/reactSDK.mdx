import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

:::info
These docs are for using our react SDK in a single-user, client side context. For react native mobile clients, try our [react native sdk](/client/reactNativeSDK)
:::

## Background

The Statsig React SDK builds on top of the React Context and Hooks APIs, which are only supported in React v16.8.0+.
If this requirement prevents you from using the SDK, please [let us know](https://github.com/statsig-io/statsig-feedback/issues).

If you are unfamiliar with using React Hooks, be sure to read the [rules of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html).

Also note that this SDK wraps the [statsig-js](/client/jsClientSDK) sdk, and reuses a number of concepts introduced in that SDK.
This includes:

- initialization options have the same set of parameters, with additional react-specific parameters.
- hooks for DynamicConfigs return the same `DynamicConfig` object
- the `useStatsig` hook returns the internal `statsig-js` sdk, with all the functionality.

Refer to the [statsig-js](jsClientSDK) documentation for more information.

#### Installing the SDK

You can install the statsig SDK via npm or yarn.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    {label: 'NPM', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install statsig-react
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add statsig-react
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### v1.0.0 Update

Migrates the `statsig-react` sdk to v4.0 of the `statsig-js` SDK.  This introduces a number of breaking changes and enhancements.

Breaking Changes:
- Removed the `useStatsig` hook.  Instead, use `import Statsig from 'statsig-react'` to use the `statsig-js` sdk for event logging, or gate checks/event logging outside of a component tree.  NOTE: SDK methods like `checkGate` and `logEvent` will throw if called before `initialize()` - to avoid errors in your component tree, check `initStarted` from the `StatsigContext`, or globally, check `Statsig.initializedCalled()`
- Removed the separate `DynamicConfig` type, instead directly exporting the same type from the `statsig-js` sdk.

Enhancements and Bug Fixes:
- Unify the type of `DynamicConfig` to be a single type across this SDK and the `statsig-js` sdk.
- Memoizes the result of gate/config checks for a given user for enhanced performance and to reduce duplicate exposures.
- Adds `initializationComponent` to render while initializing if `waitForInitialization` is `true`
- Fetches cached flag values from local storage while initialize is pending if `waitForInitialization` is `false`
- Fixes an issue where changing the user object could trigger an `updateUser` while the SDK was initializing, which would throw an exception

Additional features (inherited from `statsig-js`).  See the [releases](https://github.com/statsig-io/js-client/releases) for more details:
- `DynamicConfig` overrides
- Ability to `checkGate` and `getConfig` without overrides
- Improved support for browsers + event logging, SSR logging bug fix, and configurations for event batch sizes and event flush intervals.

:::info
If you are calling methods on the global `Statsig` like `initialize` or `updateUser`, the user object tracked by the provider and the user object used outside the component tree can get out of sync.  You are responsible for maintaining the state of the `user` and keeping it consistent with the `StatsigProvider` in these cases.  The `statsig-react` SDK uses the global `Statsig` class to serve gate/config/experiment checks, but these are memoized in the hooks the SDK provides.  Updates to the user which impact flag values that are made outside the context of the react component tree will not be reflected in the component tree unless the updated user is passed in to the `StatsigProvider`.
:::

#### Usage

How we at Statsig use the SDK, and suggested usage.

At the root of your component tree, wrap your app in a `StatsigProvider` and set `waitForInitialization=true` (if you do not wait for initialization, `useGate` hooks will return false on the first render, and will only update to the actual gate value once SDK initialization completes and Gates are fetched for the passed in user.  Similarly, `useConfig` and `useExperiment` will return empty dynamic configs).



```react

import { StatsigProvider } from 'statsig-react';

...

<StatsigProvider
    sdkKey="<CLIENT_SDK_KEY>"
    user={{
      userID: <LOGGED_IN_USER_ID>,
      email: session?.user?.email ?? undefined,
      ... // other user parameters
    }}
    waitForInitialization={true}>
    <Component />
</StatsigProvider>
```

Then, in your app, the `useGate`, `useConfig`, and `useExperiment` hooks will provide the up to date values of Feature Gates, DynamicConfigs, and Experiments (respectively) for the initialized user.  If you are unfamiliar with React Hooks, see the [rules of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html).

```react
import { useGate } from 'statsig-react';

...

export default function MyComponent(): JSX.Element {
  // only call hooks at the top level of a functional component
  const featureOn = useGate(<MY_FEATURE_GATE>).value;

  return {featureOn ? <MyComponent /> : null;
}
```

To logEvents, get the global javascript SDK

```react
import { Statsig } from 'statsig-react';

...

export default function MyComponent(): JSX.Element {

  return
    <Button
      onClick={() => {
        Statsig.logEvent('button_clicked');
      }}
    />;
}
```

If you need to check gates/configs in a loop, you can use this same import to avoid using the Feature Gate and Config hooks improperly in a loop.


#### More Details

The `statsig-react` sdk exports the following components:

##### `StatsigProvider`
StatsigProvider is a [react context provider](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextprovider) which initializes the SDK, and passes down its state to the rest of the react application via a `StatsigContext`.  It takes the following properties:

- `children: React.ReactNode | React.ReactNode[];` - One or more child components
- `sdkKey: string;` - A client SDK key from the Statsig Console
- `user: statsig.StatsigUser;` - A Statsig User object.  Changing this will update the user and Gate values, causing a re-initialization
- `options?: statsig.StatsigOptions;` - An optional bag of initialization properties (shared with the statsig-js sdk) for advanced configuration
- `waitForInitialization?: boolean;` - Waits for the SDK to initialize with updated values before rendering child components

#### Hooks
The SDK exposes Feature Gates, Dynamic Configs, Experiments, and the underlying [statsig-js](/client/jsClientSDK).  If you are unfamiliar with hooks, be sure to check out the [rules of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html)

##### `useGate`
A react hook to get a Statsig Feature Gate.

Parameters:
- `gateName: string` - the name of the gate to check


Returns:
- `GateResult`
-   `isLoading: boolean;` - the loading/initializing state of the SDK
-   `value: boolean` - the value of the feature gate (false by default)

##### `useConfig`
A react hook to get a Statsig Dynamic Config.

Parameters:
- `configName: string` - the name of the config to get


Returns:
- `ConfigResult`
-   `isLoading: boolean;` - the loading/initializing state of the SDK
-   `config: DynamicConfig` - the backing `DynamicConfig` (see the [statsig-js sdk docs](/client/jsClientSDK) for more information)

##### `useExperiment`
A react hook to get a Statsig Experiment, represented as a DynamicConfig.

Parameters:
- `experimentName: string` - the name of the experiment to get


Returns:
- `ConfigResult`
-   `isLoading: boolean;` - the loading/initializing state of the SDK
-   `config: DynamicConfig` - the backing `DynamicConfig` (see the [statsig-js sdk docs](/client/jsClientSDK) for more information)

##### `useStatsigLogEffect`
A react hook to simplify top level logEvents into an effect which will only log and event once the SDK is ready

Parameters: none
- `eventName: string`
- `value?: string | number | null`
- `metadata?: Record<string, string> | null`


##### `StatsigContext`
StatsigContext is a [react context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) used internally by the SDK to manage internal state.  You should not need to use the `StatsigContext` directly, as the Provider and Hooks interface with it for you.  It tracks the following state:

- `initialized: boolean;` the initialization state of the SDK
- `statsigPromise: React.MutableRefObject<Promise<void>> | null;` a reference to a promise which resolves once SDK initialization is complete
- `statsig: typeof statsig | undefined;` the statsig-js SDK, or undefined if uninitialized
- `userVersion` used interally by the SDK to memoize SDK functions based on the user

##### `Statsig`
You can import the global `Statsig` singleton to call SDK functions outside of a component tree or in callbacks/loops/or wherever else you are unable to use hooks.  For all SDK functions, see the [statsig-js sdk docs](/client/jsClientSDK).

:::info
If you are calling methods on the global `Statsig` like `initialize` or `updateUser`, the user object tracked by the provider and the user object used outside the component tree can get out of sync.  You are responsible for maintaining the state of the `user` and keeping it consistent with the `StatsigProvider` in these cases.  The `statsig-react` SDK uses the global `Statsig` class to serve gate/config/experiment checks, but these are memoized in the hooks the SDK provides.  Updates to the user which impact flag values that are made outside the context of the react component tree will not be reflected in the component tree unless the updated user is passed in to the `StatsigProvider`.

#### Testing

Internally at Statsig, we use this jest mock to test our components:

```js
jest.mock('statsig-react', () => {
  return {
    StatsigProvider: ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => children,
    useGate: () => {
      return false;
    },
    useConfig: () => {
      return {};
    },
    useExperiment: () => {},
    useStatsig: () => {
      return {
        logEvent: () => {},
        checkGate: () => false,
        getConfig: () => {
          return {
            get: (name: string, fallback: any) => fallback,
            getValue: (name: string, fallback: any) => fallback,
          };
        },
      };
    },
  };
});
```
