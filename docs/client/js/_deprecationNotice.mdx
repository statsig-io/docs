:::warning DEPRECATED
To get started with Statsig in JS, you should use the new [`Statsig JS SDK`](/client/javascript-sdk).

This version of the JS Client SDK is deprecated and will only receive major bug fixes going forward.

If you already use this deprecated version of the JS SDK, you should check out the [migration docs](/client/javascript-sdk/migrating-from-statsig-js).
