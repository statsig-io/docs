:::warning DEPRECATED
To get started with Statsig in Expo, you should use the new [`Statsig Expo SDK`](/client/javascript-sdk/expo).

This version of the SDK is deprecated and will only receive major bug fixes going forward.

If you already use this deprecated version, you should check out the [migration docs](/client/javascript-sdk/migrating-from-statsig-react).
:::


Statsig client side SDK for applications in React Native using Expo. If you are not using Expo, check out our plain [React Native SDK](./reactNativeSDK). This SDK is based on our [JavaScript client SDK](https://github.com/statsig-io/js-client).

## Installation {#installation}

You can install the SDK via npm or yarn. In your project directory, run:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    {label: 'NPM', value: 'npm'},
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install statsig-react-native-expo
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add statsig-react-native-expo
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next you can import Statsig in your code and use it away!

```jsx
import {
  StatsigProvider,
  useGate,
  useExperiment,
  useConfig,
  Statsig,
} from "statsig-react-native-expo";
```

If you run into build errors, see the FAQ below.

## Usage {#usage}

v4.X.X of our react-native-expo SDK wraps the [statsig-react](./reactSDK) sdk. It contains the same React Context, Providers, and Hooks, used in the same way. Get started with our [suggested usage](./reactSDK#usage) or the [Provider and Hooks](/client/deprecated/reactSDK#more-details) details.

:::info
Be sure to update the imports from the examples on the react SDK docs to use "statsig-react-native-expo" instead of "statsig-react"

### FAQ
If you get build errors when trying to install and use the SDK for the first time, you may need to install a few dependencies and rebuild with a clean cache.  We've only encountered these errors when using `eas` to build an expo app, but perhaps there are other build tools that will be missing these dependencies.

For example:

```
Error: [@RNC/AsyncStorage]: NativeModule: AsyncStorage is null
```

Means you need to install the AsyncStorage dependency

```
npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

And this:
```
ERROR  [Statsig] An unexpected exception occurred. [TypeError: Cannot read property 'getRandomBase64String' of undefined]
```
Means you need to install the random values depedency:

```
npx expo install expo-random
```

Finally, you can clear the cache in an `eas` build like this:

```
eas build -p ios --clear-cache
```

For non `eas` users, you may need to do a `pod install` in the `ios` folder of your app as well.
