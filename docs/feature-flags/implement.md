:::note

Usually referred to online as _feature flags_, the Statsig UI and SDKs call them _feature gates_.

:::

## Use a language-specific Statsig SDK to implement a feature gate in your application

Statsig provides client and server SDKs as well as HTTP APIs to implement your feature gate check in your application. You can also choose an SDK based on a language of your choice.
