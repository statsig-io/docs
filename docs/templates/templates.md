# Templates

## Overview 
Templates enable you to create a blueprint for gates/ experiments to enable standardization and reusability across your Project. Templates can help enforce a rollout sequence, or make it easy for new experimenters to get up & running with your standard team settings for experimentation. 

Templates can be enforced at the Org (via [Organization Settings](https://docs.statsig.com/org-admin/organization_policies) and [Role-based Access Controls](https://docs.statsig.com/access-management/projects)) or at the [Team-level](https://docs.statsig.com/access-management/teams). We will detail the various levels of controls and permissions you can enable for templates below. 

## Creating Templates 
There are two primary ways to create a new template- 
1. From the **Templates** tab in **Project Settings**
2. From a gate/ experiment you want to turn into a new template

### Creating Templates from Project Settings 
To create a new template from Project Settings, navigate to **Settings** -> **Project Settings** -> **Templates** and click the **+Create New** CTA, then select whether you want to create a gate or experiment template.

### Converting an Existing Config into a Template 
If you create a new config that you think would be useful to more folks on the team as a template, you can convert an existing (or currently being created) config into a template. To do this, in the config you wish to convert to a template, tap the "..." menu and select **Save as Template**. This will prompt you to name your template and add a description before saving.

## Managing Templates 
Templates can be managed via the **Templates** tab within **Project Settings**. Note that permissions for who can/ can't create or modify templates are managed via Statsig's Role-based Access Controls in the **Project Settings** -> **Members** -> **Roles**. By default Org and Project Admins can modify or delete any Template.

## Creating Configs from Templates 
To create a config using a template, at the time of config creation, select a template to apply from the template selector. If templates are required at the Organization or Team-level, the user will be blocked from proceeding with config creation until they've selected an approved template. The list of template options in the drop-down is configured at the team level (see below).

## Managing Templates- Settings & Permissions
There are a few key layers of settings governing templates, namely at the- 
1. Org level
2. Team level

### Org-level Templates Settings 
Within Experiment and Gate Policies (**Organization Settings** -> **Organization Info** -> **Experiment Settings**/ **Gate Settings**), you can enforce that a template is used for any new gate/ experiment creation. Only organization admins can configure this setting. NOTE that you must create at least 1 experiment/ gate template for users to choose if you toggle on this setting, otherwise they will be blocked in creating new configs.

### Team-level Templates Settings
At the team-level, you can configure which templates members of that team can choose from at the time of config creation. You can also choose whether to require use of a template or not at the team level (note that this setting only applies if templates aren't already required at the organization-level, in which case that overrides any team-level configuration). 

To configure team-specific templates, navigate to **Settings** -> **Project Settings** -> **Members** -> **Teams** -> choose a team -> **Settings** and then choose which templates are allowed for experiments and gates respectively.
