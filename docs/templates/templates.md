# Templates
Templates enable you to templatize gates/ experiments to enable standardization and reusability across your Project. Templates can help enforce a rollout sequence, or make it easy for new experimenters to get up & running with your standard team settings for experimentation. 

Templates can be enforced at the Org (via [Organization Settings](https://docs.statsig.com/org-admin/organization_policies) and [Role-based Access Controls](https://docs.statsig.com/access-management/projects)) or at the [Team-level](https://docs.statsig.com/access-management/teams). We will detail the various levels of controls and permissions you can enable for templates below.
