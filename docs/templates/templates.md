# Templates

## Overview 
Templates enable you to templatize gates/ experiments to enable standardization and reusability across your Project. Templates can help enforce a rollout sequence, or make it easy for new experimenters to get up & running with your standard team settings for experimentation. 

Templates can be enforced at the Org (via [Organization Settings](https://docs.statsig.com/org-admin/organization_policies) and [Role-based Access Controls](https://docs.statsig.com/access-management/projects)) or at the [Team-level](https://docs.statsig.com/access-management/teams). We will detail the various levels of controls and permissions you can enable for templates below. 

## Creating Templates 
There are two primary ways to create a new template- 
1. From the **Templates** tab in **Project Settings**
2. From a gate/ experiment you want to templatize (converting a config into a template)

### Creating Templates from Project Settings 
To create a new template from Project Settings, navigate to **Settings** -> **Project Settings** -> **Templates** and click the **+Create New** CTA, then select whether you want to create a gate or experiment template.

### Converting an Existing Config into a Template 
If you create a new config that you think would be useful to more folks on the team as a template, you can convert an existing (or currently being created) config into a template. To do this, in the config you wish to templatize, tap the "..." menu and select **Save as Template**. This will prompt you to name your template and add a description before saving.
