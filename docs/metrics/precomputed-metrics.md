## Importing Precomputed Metrics

### Importing Precomputing Metrics from your Data Warehouse

Statsig integrates natively with cloud data warehouses such as [Snowflake](/data-warehouse-ingestion/snowflake), [BigQuery](/data-warehouse-ingestion/bigquery), [Redshift](/data-warehouse-ingestion/redshift) to ingest any of your existing metrics for computing experiment results. See [Data Warehouse Ingestion](/data-warehouse-ingestion/introduction) to get started.

## Debugging Precomputed Metrics

Statsig creates a metric detail page for all precomputed metrics that you import from your data warehouse. These metric detail pages take a few hours to generate post-import or ingestion. The fastest way to start seeing and debugging your precomputed metrics is via the **Metrics Logstream** in the **Metrics Catalog** tab within **Metrics**.

The **Metrics Stream** will surface all ingested, precomputed metrics in real-time as they are ingested, enabling you to check metric name, metric value, unit identifier, ID type, and ingestion date.

Customers can trip up on ensuring that their precomputed metrics have the right ID type. Pay extra attention to this column!

Finally, the **Metrics Stream** only appears if you're actively ingesting precomputed metrics. If you're not seeing it appear at the bottom of your **Metrics Catalog**, Statsig likely is not receiving your precomputed metrics due to a connection issue or an invalid schema.
