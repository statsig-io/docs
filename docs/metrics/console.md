Metrics are available for all unit types enabled in the project.  User ID and Stable ID are provided by default and others can be added following [these steps](https://docs.statsig.com/guides/experiment-on-custom-id-types#step-1---add-companyid-as-a-new-id-type-in-your-project-settings).  Make a selection from the drop down to view event DAU and user accounting metrics calculated based on the desired unit type.

## Events
The Metrics console allows you to visualize all the events that you have logged in Statsig. The **Events** tab shows all the events, including a real-time stream of events as they come in.

You can toggle between a list view or chart view of your events to view the trend line over time.

From here you can drill into each event and see a detailed view of the logs, broken down by each unique value that was logged.

## Metrics Catalog
The **Metrics Catalog** tab allows you to search and tag your metrics, as well as [create custom metrics](https://docs.statsig.com/metrics/create). Tags enable you organize your metrics and create collections of metrics that are associated in some way. For example, you could tag a set of metrics focused on a product area, business function, business objective, and so on. You can also create a loose collection of guardrail metrics that teams check in every experiment to ensure there are causing no unexpected effects in other parts of the business. Once you create a tagged collection of metrics, you can easily pull up this set of metrics when viewing your experiment results and zoom into the context that you want to focus on.

 Similar to the **Events** tab, you can toggle between a list view or chart view of your metrics to view the trend line over time.

## Charts
The **Charts** tab shows a set of user-level metric charts that are automatically created based on the events that you log, such as daily/ weekly/ monthly active users, user stickiness, and retention. You can also create custom charts that enable you to visualize customer journeys through your application.
