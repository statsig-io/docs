# How Metrics Work on Statsig

A metric in Statsig is a numeric value for each user on a given day. This value can be aggregated across the entire user base or a subset, such as the test group of an experiment. 

For example, say a user made two purchases on September 1st. This value can be aggregated across multiple users to calculate the total number of purchases across all users on September 1st.


## Two Sources of Statsig Metrics 

There are two sources of metrics in Statsig:
1. **Raw Events** - Statsig [auto-generates certain metrics](/metrics/metrics-from-events) such as _event_count_ and _event_dau_ from these events; you can also convert these events into metrics via [Custom Metrics](/metrics/create)
2. **Precomputed Metrics** - you can provide these pre-computed values to Statsig 

Statsig's Stats Engine joins these metrics with your exposure events from feature gates and experiments to compute experiment results and analytics.

:::info How are events and metrics billed?
Each event (or a row when importing from your data warehouse) is billed once, regardless of how many experiments the event is used in.
