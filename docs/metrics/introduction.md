# Metrics User Guide

Statsig combines data from any of your existing data sources to give you a complete view of your product metrics as well as the impact new features and experiments have on these metrics. 

Statsig automatically creates these metrics from the **raw events** that you log from your application as well as raw and transformed events you send to Statsig via a data collector.

Statsig can also reuse your existing, **precomputed metrics** by natively integrating and pulling data from your cloud data warehouse. You can also choose to ingest metrics into Statsig using an HTTP endpoint or Azure Blob storage.

The **Metrics User Guide** consists of [Metrics 101](metrics-101), [201](metrics-201), and [301](metrics-301) level guides that step through basic concepts to real-time analytics in Statsig. 

Statsig combines product experimentation with real-time analytics to help you achieve 360° **product observability**.
