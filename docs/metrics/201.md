# Overview

In this 201-level user guide, you'll learn to create your own metrics and organize them as your project grows. You'll also be able to customize the definition of your daily active users (DAU).   

1. [Creating Custom Metrics](/metrics/201/create) for your product in the Statsig console
2. [Creating Metric Tags](/metrics/201/create-metric-tags) to organize the metrics in your Statsig Project
3. [Customizing the DAU Definition](/metrics/201/user) that Statsig uses to compute [User Accounting](/metrics/101/metrics-from-events#user-accounting-metrics) metrics.
