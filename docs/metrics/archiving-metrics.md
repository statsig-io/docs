# Archiving Metrics 

### Archiving a Metric 
To archive a metric, select the metric(s) you want to archive. Once you've selected at least one metric, you will see a toolbar of options appear to **Archive**, **Compare**, or **Tag** the selected metrics.

Tap the **Archive** button and you will see the metric change to a disabled state with the "Archived" symbol next to it to indicate that it is archived.

### Implications of Archiving a Metric 
If you archive a metric, the metric will be hidden in your Metrics Catalog and in Pulse. This means- 

- Archived metrics will not show up in your Metric Catalog search. To access all archived metrics, go to the last page(s) of your Metrics Catalog. 
- Archived metrics will be removed from Pulse, including any time the archived metric has been added to the Scorecard of an experiment or the Monitoring Metrics section of a Feature Gate 
- Any custom metrics that leverage an archived metric will not be impacted, as we are still computing all archived metrics on the backend. However, it's still recommended to take a pass on any
