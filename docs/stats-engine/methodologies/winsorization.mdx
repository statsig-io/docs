## Winsorization 

Winsorization is a common technique for removing noise in experiment results, specifically from outliers.

Winsorization refers to the practice of measuring the percentile Px of a metric and setting all values over Px to Px.

Statsig computes the Px value using all non-zero and non-null values of the metric.
