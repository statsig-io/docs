## Delta Method

CUPED is a technique Statig uses in which we use information about an experiment's users from before an experiment started to reduce the variance in their experiment metrics. This also can help to debias experiments which have meaningful pre-exposure bias (e.g. the groups were randomly different before any treatment was applied).

See more at the [Variance Reduction](../variance-reduction.md) page.
