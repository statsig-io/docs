Confidence intervals are an intuitive way to quantify the uncertainty in the observed metric deltas. A 95% confidence interval should contain the true effect 95% of the time. This means that if we ran an experiment 100 times, the true value of the metric delta should be inside the confidence intervals 95 times.

In practical terms, a 95% confidence interval that doesn't contain zero (the green bar above) represents a statistically significant result (with _&alpha; = 0.05_). Only 5% of the time would we expect to see the confidence interval exclude zero if the true effect was zero (a.k.a. a false positive). Larger confidence intervals imply less certainty in the exact size of the effect with a larger range of likely values.

## Computing Confidence Intervals

Confidence intervals in Statsig are calculated using a two-sample z-test. This test requires knowledge of the variance in the metric delta we're measuring, which is derived differently depending on the type of metric (details [here](/stats-engine/variance)).

Once we've established the variance of the delta, it's straighforward to compute the confidence intervals.

### Two-Sided Tests

For the **absolute metric delta**, the confidence interval is given by:

$$\Large
CI(\Delta \overline{X}) = \Delta \overline{X} \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{{var(\Delta \overline{X})}}  
$$

where:

- $Z_{\alpha/2}$ is the z-critical value for the desired significance level (1.96 for the standard $\alpha=0.05$ and 95% confidence interval) and we run a two-sided test
- $var(\Delta \overline{X})$ is the variance of the absolute delta (details [here](/stats-engine/variance))

Similarly, the confidence interval for the **relative metric delta** is:

$$\Large
CI(\Delta \overline X\%)
= \Delta \overline X\% \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \cdot\sqrt{{var(\Delta \overline X\%)}}
= \Delta \overline X\% \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \cdot\frac{\sqrt{{var\left(\Delta \overline X\right)}}}{\overline X_c} \cdot 100\% 
$$

### One-Sided Tests

When running one-sided tests, the form of of the confidence interval calculation changes slightly to account for a redistribution of desired false positive rate when looking for increases or decreases in the metric:

$$\Large
\begin{split}
CI(\Delta \overline{X}) &= \left(\Delta \overline{X}, \Delta \overline{X} + Z_{\alpha} \cdot \sqrt{{var(\Delta \overline{X})}}  \right)\\
&or\\
&= \left(\Delta \overline{X} - Z_{\alpha} \cdot \sqrt{{var(\Delta \overline{X})}}  , \Delta \overline{X}\right)
\end{split}
$$

where:

- $Z_{\alpha}$ is the z-critical value for the desired significance level (1.645 for the standard $\alpha=0.05$ and 95% confidence interval) and we run a one-sided test
- $var(\Delta \overline{X})$ is the same as for two-sided tests
- the choice of confidence interval depends on if the one-sided test is looking for increases or decreases in the metric

## Welch's T-test for Small Sample Sizes

For small sample sizes, we use Welch's t-test instead of a standard z-test. This statistical test is a better choice for handling samples of unequal size or variance without increasing the false positive rate. The structure of the confidence interval calculation remains the same as above (depending on 1- or 2-sided test), replacing the z-critical value with the t-critical value with degrees of freedom $\nu$.

For a two-sided test, the confidence interval is therefore:

$$\Large
CI(\Delta \overline{X}) = \Delta \overline{X} \pm t_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{{var(\Delta \overline{X})}}  
$$

$$\Large
\nu = \frac{\left(var(\overline X_t) + var(\overline X_c)\right)^2}{\frac{var(\overline X_t)^2}{N_t - 1}+\frac{var(\overline X_c)^2}{N_c - 1}}
= \frac{var(\Delta\overline{X})^2}{\frac{var(\overline X_t)^2}{N_t - 1}+\frac{var(\overline X_c)^2}{N_c - 1}}
$$

Where $N_t$ and $N_c$ are the number of users in the test and control groups, respectively. Note that for large number of degrees of freedom, the t-statistic converges with the z-statistic. Therefore, Welch's t-test is used only when $\nu < 100$.

## Compare Experiment Data to a Fixed Baseline: One-sample T-test

Sometimes we want to answer questions like "Does my test variant lead to a click through rate higher than 0.5?". You can define a fixed-baseline comparison when adding metrics to the experiment.

The confidence interval is calculated by

$$\Large
CI(\Delta \overline X) = (\overline X_{group} - fixed \ value) \pm Z \cdot\sqrt{{var( \overline X_{group})}}
$$
