To use the SDK, add the following to your mix.exs:

```python
{:statsig_elixir, "~> 0.0.6-beta.7"},
```

SDK is written using rustler_precompiled, which will download precompiled binary by default. But there is also an option to build Rust code within your project by
```python
# set the environment variable 
FORCE_STATSIG_NATIVE_BUILD="true"
```
