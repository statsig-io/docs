## Performance Benefits

The .NET Core SDK leverages Statsig's high-performance Rust evaluation engine through FFI bindings, details:

- Native Rust evaluation engine handles all rule processing
- .NET wrapper provides familiar C# APIs and type safety
- Automatic memory management between .NET and Rust boundaries
- Thread-safe operations across the FFI boundary

## Async/Await Support

All network operations are fully async:

```csharp
await statsig.Initialize();
await statsig.FlushEvents();
await statsig.Shutdown();
```

Evaluation methods are synchronous for optimal performance:

```csharp
var result = statsig.CheckGate(user, "gate_name");
```

## Thread Safety

The Statsig instance is thread-safe and can be used concurrently across multiple threads. Consider using the shared instance(singleton) pattern for application-wide usage:

```csharp
var sharedStatsig = Statsig.NewShared("server-secret-key");
await sharedStatsig.Initialize();

var statsig = Statsig.Shared();
```
