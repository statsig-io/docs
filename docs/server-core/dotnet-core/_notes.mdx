## Performance Benefits

The .NET Core SDK leverages Statsig's high-performance Rust evaluation engine through FFI bindings, providing:

- **Sub-millisecond evaluation times** for feature gates and experiments
- **Memory-efficient** configuration caching and user context handling
- **Concurrent evaluation** support for high-throughput applications
- **Optimized network communication** with automatic retry logic and compression

## FFI Architecture

The SDK uses Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to communicate with the Rust core:

- Native Rust evaluation engine handles all rule processing
- .NET wrapper provides familiar C# APIs and type safety
- Automatic memory management between .NET and Rust boundaries
- Thread-safe operations across the FFI boundary

## Async/Await Support

All network operations are fully async:

```csharp
await statsig.Initialize();
await statsig.FlushEvents();
await statsig.Shutdown();
```

Evaluation methods are synchronous for optimal performance:

```csharp
var result = statsig.CheckGate(user, "gate_name");
```

## Thread Safety

The Statsig instance is thread-safe and can be used concurrently across multiple threads. Consider using the shared instance pattern for application-wide usage:

```csharp
var sharedStatsig = Statsig.NewShared("server-secret-key");
await sharedStatsig.Initialize();

var statsig = Statsig.Shared();
```

## Error Handling

The SDK handles network errors gracefully:

- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Fallback to cached configurations during network issues
- Default values returned when evaluations fail
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Requirements

- **.NET 8.0** or later
- **Windows, macOS, or Linux** (x64 and ARM64 supported)
- **Network access** to Statsig APIs (configurable endpoints)
