      ## Why Migrate?

      - **Performance**: Python Core evaluates significantly faster than the legacy SDK
      - **New Features**: Access to new features and improvements
      - **Future Support**: All new features and improvements will only be available in Python Core
      - **Maintenance**: The legacy Python SDK is in maintenance mode and will only receive critical bug fixes
