## Installation Differences

### Legacy Python SDK

```bash
pip install statsig
```

### Python Core SDK

```bash
pip install statsig-core
```

Python Core requires both the core library and a platform-specific native library. The pip package includes pre-built binaries for common platforms:

- Linux (x86_64, aarch64)
- macOS (x86_64, arm64)
- Windows (x86_64)
