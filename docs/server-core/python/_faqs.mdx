## Process Forking and WSGI Servers

### ⚠️ Warning: Do not fork processes after Statsig initialization

**Important:** Never fork processes after calling `statsig.initialize()`. Doing so will put Statsig in a weird state and may cause deadlocks.

The Python Core SDK uses internal threading and async runtime components that do not work correctly when copied across process boundaries. When a process forks after initialization, these components can become corrupted, leading to:

- Deadlocks in event logging
- Hanging initialization calls
- Unpredictable SDK behavior
- Silent failures in feature evaluation

### Correct initialization for WSGI servers

For production deployments using WSGI servers like uWSGI or Gunicorn, ensure Statsig is initialized **after** the worker processes are forked, not in the main process.

#### ✅ Correct: uWSGI example

```python
# app.py
from statsig_python_core import Statsig, StatsigOptions
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
statsig = None

def init_statsig():
    global statsig
    if statsig is None:
        options = StatsigOptions()
        options.environment = "production"
        statsig = Statsig("your-server-secret-key", options)
        statsig.initialize().wait()

# Initialize in each worker process
@app.before_first_request
def before_first_request():
    init_statsig()

@app.route('/')
def index():
    # Use statsig here
    return "Hello World"
```

```ini
# uwsgi.ini
[uwsgi]
module = app:app
master = true
processes = 4
# Statsig will be initialized in each worker process
```

#### ✅ Correct: Gunicorn example

```python
# gunicorn_config.py
def post_fork(server, worker):
    # Initialize Statsig after worker process is forked
    from app import init_statsig
    init_statsig()

# app.py - same as uWSGI example above
```

```bash
# Start Gunicorn with post-fork hook
gunicorn --config gunicorn_config.py app:app
```
