### Experiment Methods

```rust
// Get experiment evaluation for a user
pub fn get_experiment(&self, user: &StatsigUser, experiment_name: &str) -> Experiment

// Get experiment configured for a specific group name
pub fn get_experiment_by_group_name(&self, user: &StatsigUser, experiment_name: &str, group_name: &str) -> Experiment
```

### Fields Needed Methods (Enterprise Only)

```rust
// Get user fields needed for a gate evaluation
pub fn get_fields_needed_for_gate(&self, gate_name: &str) -> Vec<String>

// Get user fields needed for a dynamic config evaluation
pub fn get_fields_needed_for_dynamic_config(&self, config_name: &str) -> Vec<String>

// Get user fields needed for an experiment evaluation
pub fn get_fields_needed_for_experiment(&self, experiment_name: &str) -> Vec<String>

// Get user fields needed for a layer evaluation
pub fn get_fields_needed_for_layer(&self, layer_name: &str) -> Vec<String>
```
