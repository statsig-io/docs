### Fields Needed Methods (Enterprise Only)

```rust
// Get fields needed for a gate
let fields_needed: Vec<String> = statsig.get_fields_needed_for_gate("gate_name");

// Get fields needed for a dynamic config
let fields_needed: Vec<String> = statsig.get_fields_needed_for_dynamic_config("config_name");

// Get fields needed for an experiment
let fields_needed: Vec<String> = statsig.get_fields_needed_for_experiment("experiment_name");

// Get fields needed for a layer
let fields_needed: Vec<String> = statsig.get_fields_needed_for_layer("layer_name");
```

These methods return a vector of strings representing the user fields that are referenced in the targeting rules or conditions of the specified feature. This can be useful for understanding which user properties influence a particular feature's behavior.

#### Field Mapping

The fields returned by these methods correspond to the following user properties:

```rust
// Field mapping between user properties and internal field names
let field_mapping = std::collections::HashMap::from([
    ("userID", "u"),
    ("email", "e"),
    ("ip", "i"),
    ("userAgent", "ua"),
    ("country", "c"),
    ("locale", "l"),
    ("appVersion", "a"),
    ("time", "t"),
    ("stableID", "s"),
    ("environment", "en"),
    ("targetApp", "ta"),
]);

// Custom fields are prefixed with "cf:"
// Example: fields.add("cf:" + field_name);
```

#### Example

```rust
// Get fields needed for the "new_homepage" gate
let fields_needed = statsig.get_fields_needed_for_gate("new_homepage");
println!("{:?}", fields_needed);
// Example output: ["country", "email", "custom.subscription_tier"]
```
