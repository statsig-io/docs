## Statsig Server Core

:::info
Statsig Server Core is currently in beta - we encourage you to try it out and give us feedback in the [Statsig Slack](https://statsig.com/slack).
:::

Statsig Server Core is a performance-focused rewrite of Statsig server SDKs with a shared core Rust library, that we're rolling out as an option for each Server Environment we currently support with SDKs. 

Server Core brings Rust's natural speed and performance optimizations to each language, as we develop them in one, shared library. Initial benchmarking suggests Server Core can evaluate **5-10x** as fast as existing SDKs. Beside evaluation performance improvement, we introduced new compression mechanism, which should **reduce outbound (egress) network payload significantly**.

:::warning
Server Core does not currently resolve User Agents or Countries. Expect this addition in the near future.
:::

Server Core also introduces many new features, for example, 
 - [Param Stores](https://docs.statsig.com/client/concepts/parameter-stores/), including bootstrap with param stores, 
 - [SDK Observability Interface](https://docs.statsig.com/sdk_monitoring/#metric-interface-methods)
 - Streaming Config Specs and etc. 

Server Core is currently available for Java, Node, and Python. Need another language? Let us know in the [Statsig Slack](https://statsig.com/slack) and we'll prioritize it.
