## Statsig Server Core

Statsig Server Core is a performance-focused rewrite of our server SDKs with a shared, core Rust library. With extensive optimization and Rust's inherent speed, Core SDKs can evaluate **5-10x** as fast as our native SDKs.

Server Core also introduces new features, like [Parameter Stores](https://docs.statsig.com/client/concepts/parameter-stores/), the [SDK Observability Interface](https://docs.statsig.com/sdk_monitoring/#metric-interface-methods), and streaming flag/experiment changes (from the [Statsig Forward Proxy](/server/concepts/forward_proxy/))

Server Core is currently available for Java, Node, Elixir, Rust and Python. Need another language, or run into any issues? Let us know in the [Statsig Slack](https://statsig.com/slack) and we'll prioritize it.
