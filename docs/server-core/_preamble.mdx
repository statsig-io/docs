## Statsig Server Core

Statsig Server Core is a performance-focused rewrite of Statsig server SDKs with a shared core Rust library, that we're rolling out as an option for each Server Environment we currently support with SDKs. 

Server Core brings Rust's natural speed and performance optimizations to each language, as we develop them in one, shared library. Initial benchmarking suggests Server Core can evaluate 5-10x as fast as existing SDKs.

Server Core is currently available for Node and Python. Need another language? Let us know in the [Statsig Slack](https://statsig.com/slack) and we'll prioritize it.
