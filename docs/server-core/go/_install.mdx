via the `go get` CLI:

```
go get github.com/statsig-io/statsig-server-core/statsig-go@latest
```

Or, add a dependency on the most recent version of the SDK in go.mod:

```
require (
  github.com/statsig-io/statsig-server-core/statsig-go v1.37.0
)
```

See the [Releases tab in GitHub](https://github.com/statsig-io/go-sdk/releases) for the latest versions.

Run the following commands to install the necessary binaries and set environment variables:

```
go install github.com/statsig-io/statsig-server-core/statsig-go/cmd/post-install@latest
post-install
```

:::note 
You may run into an error with running post-install. Run the following commands so the shell is able to find the post-install executable: 

```
macOS:
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
source ~/.zshrc

Linux:
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
source ~/.bashrc

Windows:
set PATH=%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%\.statsig\bin

```


And then try running post-install again.
:::

:::note
You may run need to set the following additional environment variables depending on your operating system if you run into linker errors:

```
macOS:
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$STATSIG_LIB_DIR"

Linux:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$STATSIG_LIB_DIR"

Windows:
set STATSIG_LIB_DIR=%USERPROFILE%\.statsig\lib
set PATH=%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%\.statsig\bin
```
:::


The system should prompt you to set the environment variables using a statsig.env file that was generated during the post-install script.
Follow the instructions to set the environment variables.

```
// E.g. - the script will look something like this:
source /Users/home-dir/.statsig_env
```
