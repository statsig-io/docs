via the `go get` CLI:

You can install the latest version of the SDK:
```
go get github.com/statsig-io/statsig-server-core/statsig-go@latest
```

or a specific version of the SDK:
```
go get github.com/statsig-io/statsig-server-core/statsig-go@v0.7.2
```

Or, add a dependency on the most recent version of the SDK in go.mod:
```
require (
  github.com/statsig-io/statsig-server-core/statsig-go v0.7.2
)
```

See the [Releases tab in GitHub](https://github.com/statsig-io/statsig-server-core/releases) for the latest versions.

:::note
Running `go get` will only work if you're working inside a module project with a go.mod file. If working outside of a module project, you can clone the repo here: https://github.com/statsig-io/statsig-server-core/tree/main/statsig-go instead.

Run the following commands to install the necessary binaries and set environment variables:

```
go install github.com/statsig-io/statsig-server-core/statsig-go/cmd/post-install@latest

// Run the following commands based on your OS:
// macOS:
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
source ~/.zshrc

// Linux:
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
source ~/.bashrc

// Windows (PowerShell):
$env:PATH += ";$env:USERPROFILE\.statsig\bin"

post-install
```

The system should prompt you to set the environment variables using a statsig.env or statsig.env.ps1 file that was generated during the post-install script.
Follow the instructions to set the environment variables.

```
// E.g. - the command will look something like this:

macOS: 
source /Users/Your-User-Name/.statsig_env

Windows (PowerShell): 
. "C:\Users\Your-User-Name\.statsig_env.ps1"
```

Users can also add in the variables to their .bashrc, .zshrc, or .ps1 file to load them automatically.

:::note
You may need to have gcc installed on your system in order to run the SDK on Windows. 

See [FAQ](/server-core/go-core#faq) if you run into any issues with installation.
