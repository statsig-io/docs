### Installing the Java SDK

To ensure the Statsig Java SDK works correctly on your machine, you'll need to install the core library and the correct OS/architecture-specific dependency.

Our system will automatically detect your OS and architecture, then log the appropriate dependency for you to include in your `build.gradle`. Here's how the process works:

### Step 1: Install the Core Library

You should always include the core library in your `build.gradle` file, regardless of your system:

```jsx
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.statsig:javacore:X.X.X'  // Replace X.X.X with the latest version
}
```

### Step 2: Detect Your OS and Architecture

We will automatically detect your:

- **Operating System (OS)**: Whether you are using macOS, Linux, or Windows.
- **System Architecture**: Whether your system runs on ARM (e.g., Apple Silicon M1/M2) or x86 (Intel/AMD).

To help you install the correct architecture-specific dependency, we use a logging mechanism to print the exact command you need to add to your `build.gradle` file. 

After completing Step 1, simply run the following code:

```java
import com.statsig.*;

// All StatsigOptions are optional, feel free to adjust them as needed
StatsigOptions options = new StatsigOptions.Builder()
                    .setSpecsSyncIntervalMs(10)
                    .setEventLoggingFlushIntervalMs(10)
                    .build(); 
					                    
Statsig statsig = new Statsig("your-secret-key", options);
```

You should get an output similar to the example below. The exact command may vary depending on your OS and architecture:

```jsx
For Linux with arm64 architecture, add the following to build.gradle:
  implementation 'com.statsig:javacore:<version>:amazonlinux2023-arm64'
  
For Linux with x86_64 architecture, add the following to build.gradle:
  implementation 'com.statsig:javacore:<version>:amazonlinux2023-x86_64'
```

### Step 3. **Putting It All Together**:

- **Up-to-Date Versions**: Make sure you always replace `<version>` with the latest SDK version.
- Latest Version can be found here: [https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.statsig/javacore/overview](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.statsig/javacore/overview)

Hereâ€™s an example of what your `build.gradle` might look like:

```jsx
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.statsig:javacore:X.X.X'  // Core SDK
	implementation 'com.statsig:javacore:<version>:amazonlinux2023-arm64' // OS and architecture-specific dependency
}
```
