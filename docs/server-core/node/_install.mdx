```shell
npm i @statsig/statsig-node-core
```

The Node SDK is pre-built and compiled for different OSs & CPU architectures. Package managers will resolve the correct version automatically.

#### Frozen lockfile/locked dependencies
If your service has locked dependencies with package-lock.json or pnpm-lock.yml, you'll need to include all versions you need. For example, if you develop locally on macOS, and deploy to linux, then you have to include:

```
dependencies {
    "@statsig/statsig-node-core-darwin-arm64": "0.1.0" // for macOS
    "@statsig/statsig-node-core-linux-x64-gnu": "0.1.0" // for linux x64 machines
}
```

#### Using statsig-node-core with Next.js

statsig-node-core works well with Next but can't be packaged with webpack. To prevent errors, designate @statsig/statsig-node-core as a serverExternalPackage in your next.config.js file:
```jsx
const nextConfig = {
  serverExternalPackages: ['@statsig/statsig-node-core'],
}
```
