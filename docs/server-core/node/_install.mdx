To use the Statsig Server Core SDK, install the `@statsig/statsig-node-core` package.

```shell
npm i @statsig/statsig-node-core
```

or
```
dependencies {
    "statsig/statsig-node-core": "0.0.6-beta.2" 
}
```

SDKs are pre-built and compiled according to different os and cpu architectures. In most cases, your package manager will automatically resolve the correct version, but if your service has locked dependencies with package-lock.json or pnpm-lock.yml, you'll need to be aware that you are installing all packages (architectures and system specific versions). For example, if you need to run the service locally on macOS, and deploy to linux, then you'll need to include both packages:
```
// For example
dependencies {
    "statsig/statsig-node-core-darwin-arm64": "0.0.6-beta.2" // for macOS
    "statsig/statsig-node-core-linux-x64-gnu": "0.0.6-beta.2" // for linux x64 machines
}
```

#### Using node-core with Next.js

Node-core works well with Next, but can't be packaged with webpack, and the compiler will throw errors if we let it try. To prevent this, designate @statsig/statsig-node-core as a serverExternalPackage in your next.config.js file:
```jsx
const nextConfig = {
  serverExternalPackages: ['@statsig/statsig-node-core'],
}
```
