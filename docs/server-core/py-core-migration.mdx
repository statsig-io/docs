## Overview

This guide summarizes the changes needed to migrate from the old ["statsig"](https://pypi.org/project/statsig/) Python package to the new [statsig-python-core](https://pypi.org/project/statsig/) package. For more information on the Core Server SDKs - see our [Server Core Overview](./index.mdx). Changes include a new mapping of StatsigOptions, minor core API changes, changes to the operation of ID list/ Country lookups, amongst other, smaller changes.
