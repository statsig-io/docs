This guide will help you migrate from the legacy {props.sdkType} Server SDK to the new {props.sdkType} Core SDK. The {props.sdkType} Core SDK offers significant performance improvements and new features, as it's built on a shared Rust core library.

## Why Migrate?

- **Performance**: {props.sdkType} Core evaluates faster than the legacy SDK
- **New Features**: Access to Parameter Stores, CMAB (Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits), observabilityClient, and more
- **Future Support**: All new features and improvements will only be available in {props.sdkType} Core
- **Maintenance**: The legacy {props.sdkType} SDK is in maintenance mode and will only receive critical bug fixes
