## Client SDK Bootstrapping | SSR <VersionBadge version={props.addedInVersion}/> {#bootstrap}

<div style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}>
  The {props.sdkName} server SDK supports generating the{" "}
  <code>initializeValues</code> needed to initialize a Statsig Client SDK, letting you pair your client-side initialize() calls with other requests to your server, effectively enabling zero-latency client SDK startup.

### Working with IP or UserAgent Values

The server SDK will not automatically use the `ip`, or `userAgent` for gate evaluation as
Statsig servers would, since we don't have access to the request headers. If you'd like to use the attributes we derive from these properties, like Browser Name/Version, OS Name/Version & Country, you must manually set the `ip` and `userAgent`
fields on the user object when calling <props.signature />.

### Working with IDs

To ensure that the server SDK evaluates each config accurately, they need access to all user attributes that the client SDK leverages. We recommend passing all of these attributes to the server SDK - using tools like Cookies if needed to ensure they're attached on first requests. If the user objects on the client and server aren't identical, modern SDKs will throw an [InvalidBootstrap](/sdk/debugging/#invalid-bootstrap) warning. 

Client SDKs also auto-generate a StableID, and its important to manage the lifecycle of this ID to be sure that it is consistent on client and server side. Managing this with a cookie is often easiest, see [Keeping StableID Consistent](/client/javascript-sdk#keeping-stableid-consistent-across-client--server). If StableID differs between Client and Server, you'll see a [BootstrapStableIDMismatch](https://docs.statsig.com/sdk/debugging/#bootstrapstableidmismatch) warning, and checks with this warning won't contribute to your experiment analyses.

### getClientInitializeResponse and the legacy JS SDK

If you are migrating from the legacy JS Client, you will need to make some updates to 
how your server SDK generates values. 
The default hashing algorithm was changed from `sha256` to `djb2` for performance and size reasons. 

See the [Bootstrapping Migration Docs](https://docs.statsig.com/client/javascript-sdk/migrating-from-statsig-js/#bootstrapping) for more.
