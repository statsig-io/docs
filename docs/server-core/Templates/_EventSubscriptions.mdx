## SDK Event Subscriptions

The Statsig SDK provides an event subscription system that allows you to listen for evaluation events in real-time. This feature is useful for debugging, analytics, custom logging, and integrating with external systems.

### Supported Events

The SDK supports subscribing to the following evaluation events:

- **`gate_evaluated`** - Fired when a feature gate is evaluated for a user
- **`dynamic_config_evaluated`** - Fired when a dynamic config is retrieved for a user  
- **`experiment_evaluated`** - Fired when an experiment is evaluated for a user
- **`layer_evaluated`** - Fired when a layer is evaluated for a user
- **`"*"`** - Subscribe to all evaluation events

### SDK Event Data

Each event includes relevant context about the evaluation:

- **Gate Evaluated Events** include: `gate_name`, `value` (boolean), `rule_id`, `reason`
- **Dynamic Config Events** include: the full `dynamic_config` object with values and metadata
- **Experiment Events** include: the full `experiment` object with variant assignment and parameters
- **Layer Events** include: the full `layer` object with allocated experiment and parameters

### Use Cases

Event subscriptions are particularly useful for:

- **Debugging**: Monitor which features are being evaluated and their results
- **Analytics**: Track feature usage patterns and user segments
- **Custom Logging**: Send evaluation data to your own logging systems
- **Integration**: Forward events to external analytics or monitoring tools
- **Testing**: Verify that features are being evaluated as expected

### Best Practices

- **Clean up subscriptions**: Always unsubscribe when you no longer need to listen for events to prevent memory leaks
- **Handle event data carefully**: Event objects may contain sensitive user information depending on your configuration
- **Use specific event types**: Subscribe to specific events rather than "*" when possible for better performance
- **Avoid heavy processing**: Keep event handlers lightweight to avoid impacting SDK performance
