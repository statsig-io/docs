:::info Asynchronous APIs

We mentioned earlier that after calling `initialize` most SDK APIs would run synchronously, so why are `getConfig` and `checkGate` asynchronous?

The main reason is that older versions of the SDK _might_ not know how to interpret new types of gate conditions. In such cases the SDK will make an asynchronous call to our servers to fetch the result of a check. This can be resolved by upgrading the SDK, and we will warn you if this happens.

For more details, read our [blog post about SDK evaluations](https://blog.statsig.com/evaluating-feature-gates-in-the-statsig-sdk-a6f8881a1ad8).
