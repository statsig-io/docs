And for everything else, there's always the FAQ.  We'll try to keep this list updated with more recent and common questions, and move those answers to their respective places in the docs over time.

Once an experiment has been started you cannot change the layer. Doing so would impact the integrity of the experiment. Once an experiment has been created, you can no longer change the layer (we may allow this in the future)
