The "Console API" is the CRUD API for your feature gates, autotunes, and segments.  It is currently under development and expanding to more Statsig console features.

If you have any feature requests, drop on in to our [slack channel](https://www.statsig.com/slack) and let us know.

All Console APIs share the following features:

## Authorization

All requests must include the **STATSIG-API-KEY** field in the header. The value should be a **Console API Key** which can be created in the Project Settings on [console.statsig.com/api_keys](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys)
