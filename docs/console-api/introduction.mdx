The "Console API" is the CRUD API for performing the actions offered on console.statsig.com without needing to go through the web UI.

If you have any feature requests, drop on in to our [slack channel](https://www.statsig.com/slack) and let us know.

## Authorization

All requests must include the **STATSIG-API-KEY** field in the header. The value should be a **Console API Key** which can be created in the Project Settings on [console.statsig.com/api_keys](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys)

## Rate Limiting

Mutation requests (POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE) to the Console API are limited to ~ 100 requests / 10 seconds and ~ 900 requests / 15 minutes, per project.

## API Version

The Console API is versioned. Each version is guaranteed to not break existing usage; each new version introduces breaking changes. There is currently only one version: `20240601`.

Pass the version in the **STATSIG-API-VERSION** field in the header. For now, this is optional; in the future, this will be required.
