## Get Daily Reports

You can [export your Pulse data](https://docs.statsig.com/pulse/export) via the console or using this API.  This API supports two types of daily reports:
1. [type=first_exposures](https://docs.statsig.com/pulse#first-exposures-file-description) - Provides a link to download your company's full set of "first exposures" across feature gates and experiments.
2. [type=pulse_daily](https://docs.statsig.com/pulse#pulse-summary-and-daily-file-description) - Provides a link to download your company's daily experimental results.  This data is a single day's results and a full experimental analysis requires the entire duration of the experiment.

This feature is available to Pro and Enterprise tier customers.
