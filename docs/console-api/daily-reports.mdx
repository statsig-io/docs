- After the feature is turned on for you, it will be ready when our pipeline runs. Generally, you can expect it around the time you see cumulative exposures.
- We commit to maintain the report format including column order and type, but we recommend that you use the column name and cast column type when parsing the file.

### Egress exposure data to your warehouse
Besides the exposure reports from the API access, we also offer data warehouse export to Snowflake for our enterprise customers.

> **We do NOT support this feature if your warehouse has IP restrictions.**
1. Navigate to `Tools` -> `Exports`. Under the `Scheduled` tab, create a new connection.
2. In your Snowflake warehouse, create a custom user for export purpose.
3. Run the script to create the table and grant your user permissions to operate on it.

```sql
-- create the table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE <database>.<schema>.<exportTableName> (
	COMPANY_ID VARCHAR(16777216),
	UNIT_ID VARCHAR(16777216),
	UNIT_TYPE VARCHAR(16777216),
	EXPOSURE_TYPE VARCHAR(16777216),
	NAME VARCHAR(16777216),
	RULE VARCHAR(16777216),
	EXPERIMENT_GROUP VARCHAR(16777216),
	FIRST_EXPOSURE_UTC TIMESTAMP_NTZ(9),
	FIRST_EXPOSURE_PST_DATE DATE,
	AS_OF_PST_DATE DATE,
	PERCENT FLOAT,
	ROLLOUT NUMBER(38,0),
	USER_DIMENSIONS VARCHAR(16777216),
	INSERTED_AT TIMESTAMP_NTZ(9) NOT NULL,
	RULE_NAME VARCHAR(16777216),
	GROUP_ID VARCHAR(16777216)
);

-- grant the custom user privileges to operate on the table
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLE <database>.<schema>.<exportTableName> TO ROLE <generatedRole>;
```
4. Connect. Then StatSig will run tests to make sure all privileges are granted. Once it's successful, you are enrolled in the feature.

- New columns may be added in the future.
- Exposures on the day when a decision is made are excluded from the report, as they are not part of the experiment.
- Metric values are non-CUPED.
- After the feature is turned on for you, it will be ready when our pipeline runs. Generally, you can expect it around the time you see pulse results.
