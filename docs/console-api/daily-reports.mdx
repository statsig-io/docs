## Get Daily Reports

This API supports three types of daily reports:
1. type=first_exposures - Provides a link to download your company's full set of "first exposures" across feature gates and experiments.
2. type=pulse_daily - Provides a link to download your company's daily experimental results.  This data is a single day's results and a full experimental analysis requires the entire duration of the experiment.
3. type=unit_metrics_daily - Provides a link to download your company's daily user metrics (as computed by Statsig).  This data has one row for every user/metric pair for the most recent date.

This feature is available to Pro and Enterprise tier customers.
