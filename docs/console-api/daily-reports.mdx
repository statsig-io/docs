- After the feature is turned on for you, it will be ready when our pipeline runs. Generally, you can expect it around the time you see cumulative exposures.
- We commit to maintain the report format including column order and type, but we recommend that you use the column name and cast column type when parsing the file.

### Egress exposure data to your warehouse

Besides the exposure reports from the API access, we also offer data warehouse export to Snowflake for our enterprise customers.

1. At the top of your console, tap the "?" icon and navigate to `Tools and Resources` -> `Exports List`. Under the `Scheduled` tab, create a new connection.
2. In your Snowflake warehouse, create a custom user for this export purpose.
3. Run the script to create the table and grant your user permissions to operate on it.

```sql
-- create the table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE <database>.<schema>.<exportTableName> (
	COMPANY_ID VARCHAR(16777216),
	UNIT_ID VARCHAR(16777216),
	UNIT_TYPE VARCHAR(16777216),
	EXPOSURE_TYPE VARCHAR(16777216),
	NAME VARCHAR(16777216),
	RULE VARCHAR(16777216),
	EXPERIMENT_GROUP VARCHAR(16777216),
	FIRST_EXPOSURE_UTC TIMESTAMP_NTZ(9),
	FIRST_EXPOSURE_PST_DATE DATE,
	AS_OF_PST_DATE DATE,
	PERCENT FLOAT,
	ROLLOUT NUMBER(38,0),
	USER_DIMENSIONS VARCHAR(16777216),
	INSERTED_AT TIMESTAMP_NTZ(9) NOT NULL,
	RULE_NAME VARCHAR(16777216),
	GROUP_ID VARCHAR(16777216)
);

-- grant the custom user privileges to operate on the table
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLE <database>.<schema>.<exportTableName> TO ROLE <generatedRole>;
```

4. Connect. Then StatSig will run tests to make sure all privileges are granted. Once it's successful, you are enrolled in the feature.

- New columns may be added in the future.
- Exposures on the day when a decision is made are excluded from the report, as they are not part of the experiment.
- Metric values are non-CUPED.
- After the feature is turned on for you, it will be ready when our pipeline runs. Generally, you can expect it around the time you see pulse results.
