# Topline Alerts with Logs

Detect regressions in your infrastructure by evaluating logs in real time. You can use them to monitor request success rates, error codes, or other log-derived metrics.

By combining log filters with [Topline Alerts](https://docs.statsig.com/product-analytics/alerts/topline_alerts), you will know immediately when things start failing without writing custom scripts or dashboards.

## When to Use Log-based Alerts

- **Monitoring success rates** - Ensure your team is maintaining SLOs
- **Detecting error spikes** - Monitor 5xx logs rising above baseline
- **Watching for region or client-specific issues** - Identify failures concentrated in one country or device type

## Creating a Log-based Topline Alert in Statsig Cloud
In this example, we're going to create a monitor for success rate of a GET request.

### Step 1: Navigate to Topline Alerts

- In the left menu, go to **Analytics â†’ Topline Alerts**
- Click **Create** 
- Enter a name for your alert

### Step 2: Define Alert Criteria
- Select `statsig::log_line` as your event
- Apply filters to define what constitutes success and failure. 
    - If you're unsure what fields to apply a filter on, head over to the [Log Explorer](/infra-analytics/logs-explorer) and view the log body.

### Step 3: Set Up Evaluation Formula

- Define the formula for calculating your success rate:
- Optional: Add a dimension to group by. We chose to group by country in the example below.
- Example Formula: `A/B * 100`

### Step 4: Configure Alert Thresholds
- Set your alert thresholds and evaluation window. In this example, we're saying:
    - Send me a warning when success rate drops below 99.5%
    - Send an alert when success rate drops below 99.0%

### Step 5: Configure Notifications
- Add alert details:
   - Title and description for context
   - Diagnostic hints (e.g., "Check version X" or "Android requests timing out")
- Add subscribers
- Set priority level

### Step 6: Save your alert!!
- Congrats - You've just finished creating your alert. 
- The **Diagnostics** tab will show a history of when the alert has triggered.

## Best Practices
- Keep formulas simple (ratios & percentages are easiest to scan)
- Add group-by dimensions (like country or app version) to pinpoint where issues occur
- Write clear notification text that explains what the alert means
