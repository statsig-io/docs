# Infra Analytics Overview

**[Infra Analytics](https://statsig.com/infra-analytics)** helps you monitor and debug the health of your services directly inside Statsig. It pulls in logs, metrics, and alerts so you get system-level observability in the same place you analyze product outcomes.

What you can do:  
- Search and analyze logs to investigate issues  
- Collect metrics and traces through OpenTelemetry (OTEL)  
- Create alerts tied to service health  
- Connect infrastructure signals to product analytics for a unified understanding of impact  

---

## Feature Highlights  

- **Logs Explorer**: Debug incidents with search, filters, and visualizations
- **Topline Alerts**: Catch regressions and anomalies with log/metric-based triggers
- **Metrics Explorer**: Inspect infrastructure metrics alongside product metrics
