# Infra Analytics Overview

**[Infra Analytics](https://statsig.com/infra-analytics)** helps you monitor and debug the health of your services with logs, metrics, and alerts inside Statsig. It brings system-level observability into the same platform where you analyze product outcomes, giving you a unified view across your stack.

With Infra Analytics, you can:  
- Search and analyze logs to investigate issues  
- Collect metrics and traces through OpenTelemetry (OTEL)  
- Create alerts tied to service health  
- Connect infrastructure signals to product analytics for a unified understanding of impact  

---

## Feature Highlights  

- **Logs Explorer**: Search, filter, group, and visualize logs to debug incidents and analyze patterns 
- **Topline Alerts**: Detect regressions and anomalies with log or metric based alerts
- **Metrics Explorer**: Analyze infrastructure metrics in the same place you analyze product metrics

## Start Sending Data  

To start using Logs Explorer, you need to **[set up your OTEL ingestion](/server/concepts/open_telemetry)**.
