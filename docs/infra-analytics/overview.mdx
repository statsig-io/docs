# Infra Analytics Overview

**[Infra Analytics](https://statsig.com/infra-analytics)** helps you monitor and debug the health of your services with logs, metrics, and alerts inside Statsig. It brings system-level observability into the same platform where you analyze product outcomes, giving you a unified view across your stack.

With Infra Analytics, you can:  
- Search and analyze logs to investigate issues  
- Collect metrics and traces through OpenTelemetry (OTEL)  
- Create alerts tied to service health  
- Connect infrastructure signals to product analytics for a unified understanding of impact

## Feature Highlights  

- **[Logs Explorer](/infra-analytics/logs-explorer)**: Search, filter, group, and visualize logs to debug incidents and analyze patterns 
- **[Topline Alerts](/product-analytics/alerts/topline_alerts)**: Detect regressions and anomalies with log or metric based alerts
- **[Metrics Explorer](/product-analytics/drilldown)**: Analyze infrastructure metrics in the same place you analyze product metrics
