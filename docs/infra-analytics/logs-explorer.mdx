Logs Explorer provides a way for you to search and analyze all of your product’s logs in one place. It is designed to help you quickly find the signals you care about, whether you’re debugging an incident, tracking regressions, or exploring system behavior.  

---

### Searching in Logs Explorer  
To identify the entries that matter, you can either search directly through a custom query or use our point-and-click query constructor. 

Once you’ve found something of interest, you can filter and group by metadata fields (such as service, host, or status code) to uncover patterns and trends.  
- **Filtering**: Narrow down logs to the subset relevant to your investigation.  
- **Grouping**: Aggregate logs across dimensions (service, region, status, browser, etc.).  
- **Visualization**: Plot log groupings over time to detect spikes, regressions, or unusual changes.  

### Visualizations in Logs Explorer  
In Log Explorer, visualizations make it easy to move beyond raw text logs into structured insights. For example, you can group logs by browser name and track how distributions change over time. These visualizations let you spot anomalies and shifts at a glance.

### Getting Started with Log Explorer  
To get started with Log Explorer, follow the [OTEL onboarding guide](/server/concepts/open_telemetry) to set up log ingestion. Once that's ready, you can navigate to **Infra Analytics → Log Explorer** in the Statsig sidebar to begin exploring your logs.
