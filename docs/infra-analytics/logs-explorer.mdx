Logs Explorer provides a way for you to search and analyze all of your product’s logs in one place. It works for logs, traces, and [ingested events](/infra-analytics/events-mode-logs-explorer), so you can use the same interface whether you’re debugging infra issues or investigating product event streams. 
- **Searching**: Slice logs down to only what’s relevant (by service, host, status code, etc.) 
- **Grouping**: Aggregate logs by dimensions like region, status, or browser.
- **Visualization**: Plot log groupings over time to spot spikes, regressions, or anomalies instantly.

### Searching in Logs Explorer  
You can find the logs you care about by:
- **Writing queries**: Run custom searches to zero in on specific log entries.
- **Using the query builder**: Point-and-click to construct filters without syntax overhead.

### Getting Started with Log Explorer  
To get started with Log Explorer, follow the [OTEL onboarding guide](/infra-analytics/getting-started) to set up log ingestion. Once that's ready, you can navigate to **Infra Analytics → Log Explorer** in the Statsig sidebar to begin exploring your logs. 

You can also use Logs Explorer in [Events Mode](/infra-analytics/events-mode-logs-explorer) to search and analyze your existing Statsig Events — no additional instrumentation needed.
