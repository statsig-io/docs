### Reading experiment results

To read the results of your experiment, you can zoom straight into your key metrics as well as your starred metrics that are relevant for your experiment. 
You can also deep dive into how all your metrics shifted with the experiment.   

#### Key Results
The **Key Results** panel shows how your primary metrics compare against the control for each variant.

In the example below, the **Square** variant is performing better than the **Rounded Square (control)** and **Circle** variant on all Key Metrics.

#### Metrics Lifts
The **Metrics Lifts** panel shows how your *favorited* metrics compare against the control. You can also see how *all* your other metrics compare against the control in the **All Other Metrics** section as shown below.
