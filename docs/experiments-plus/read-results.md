### Reading experiment results

To read the results of your experiment, you can zoom straight into your key metrics as well as your starred metrics that are relevant for your experiment. 
You can also deep dive into how all your metrics shifted with the experiment.   

#### Key Results
The **Key Results** panel shows how your primary metrics compare against the control for each variant.

In the example below, the **Circle** variant is performing better than the **Rounded Square (control)** for the purchase count metric though this lift isn't statistically significant. 
The **Square** variant is performing worse than the **Rounded Square (control)** and this difference is statistically significant.
