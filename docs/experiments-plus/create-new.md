### User-level Experiments
To create a user-level experiment,
1. Log into the Statsig console at [https://console.statsig.com/](https://console.statsig.com/)
2. Navigate to **Experiments+** in the left-hand navigation panel
3. Click on the **Create** button
4. Enter the name and description for your experiment as shown in the figure below
5. Click **Create**

6. In the **Allocation** panel, enter the percentage of users that you want to allocate to this experiment. By default, each experiment runs in its own layer and you can enter a value up to 100%

7. In the **Variations** panel, enter the variant names and click on **Add Another Variant** to enter more variants

   You'll find that the split percentages between these variants automatically change to evenly distribute users between these variants.

8. Continuing in the **Variations** pabel, click on the pencil icon next the _sample_parameter_ and enter the name of your experiment parameter and the type, and click **Confirm**

9. Enter the values that the experiment parameter will take for each variant

10. Enter the key metrics you want to track in this experiment

11. Click on the **Save** button at the top right hand side of the page to complete your experiment setup.


### Device-level and Custom ID Experiments
The default randomization unit for experiments is User ID.  To create an experiment with a different unit ID type, follow steps 1 - 4 above. Then,
 1. Click the **ID Type** drop down menu and make a selection.
 2. Click **Create**
 
    ![customID_experiment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90343952/140976464-1dc14853-5aa1-4a6d-853d-317e06bc6d04.png)

Now follow the remaining steps as described in the previous section to complete your experiment setup. 

### Isolated Experiments
By default, each experiment runs in its own layer. When you want to create an experiment that excludes any users exposed to other experiments, follow steps 1 -4 in 1 -4 n User-level Experiments above. Then,
1. Click the checkbox for **Add Layer**
2. Select an existing layer or _create a new layer_.
3. Click **Create**

Now follow the remaining steps as described in the top section on this page to complete your experiment setup.

### Significance Level Adjustments

By default, Pulse results are displayed with 95% confidence intervals and without Bonferroni correction.  This default can be changed during the experiment creation and can also be adjusted in the settings when viewing the results. 

* **Bonferroni Correction**: Select this option to automatically apply the correction in experiments with more than one test group.  This reduces the probability of Type I errors (false positives) by adjusting the significance level alpha, which will be divided by the number of test variants in the experiment.
* **Default Confidence Interval**: The selection will be used by default every time Pulse results are shown for this experiment.  Choose lower confidence intervals (e.g.: 80%) when there's higher tolerance for false positives and fast iteration with directional results is preferred over longer/larger experiments with increased certainty.   

### Targeting Gates

By default, this is hidden under the advanced configuration of an experiment (at the bottom of the experiment setup page).  A targeting gate will restrict the users elegible for the experiment to those who pass the list of conditions definied in the linked Feature Gate.  This continues to apply after making a decision on an experiment in the Statsig UI.
