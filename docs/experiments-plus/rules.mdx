The diagnostics stream is meant to be used for debugging your integration, and understanding which groups a user is being bucketed into.  The following defines the different Rules you will see, and what they mean.

```
+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|           **Rule**          |                                               **Meaning**                                               |
+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Not started                 | The experiment has not been started, so the allocation groups are not determined yet                    |
+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Holdout                     | The user is in a holdout that this experiment references, so they are not in the experiment             |
+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Targeting Gate              | The user does not meet the requirements for the targeting gate                                          |
+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Layer Assignment            | The user is not allocated to this experiment because they are bucketed to a different part of the Layer |
+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Allocation                  | The user is not allocated to this experiment because they do not meet the rollout %                     |
+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| {group name}{override name} | The user was forcefully bucketed into a given group by an experiment override                           |
+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| {group name}                | The user was bucketed into this experiment group                                                        |
+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Abandoned                   | "Make Decision" selected the control group.  This experiment has been abandoned.                        |
+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| {group name} (Launched)     | "Make Decision" selected this group as the launch group, so the user is seeing the launched experience. |
