The diagnostics stream is meant to be used for debugging your integration, and understanding which groups a user is being bucketed into.  The following defines the different Rules you will see, and what they mean.


| **Rule**                      | **Meaning**                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Not started                   | The experiment has not been started, so the allocation groups are not determined yet                    |
| Holdout                       | The user is in a holdout that this experiment references, so they are not in the experiment             |
| Layer Assignment              | The user is not allocated to this experiment because they are bucketed to a different part of the Layer |
| Targeting Gate                | The user does not meet the requirements for the targeting gate                                          |
| Not Allocated                 | The user is not allocated to this experiment because they do not meet the rollout %                     |
| {group name}{override name}   | The user was forcefully bucketed into a given group by an experiment override                           |
| {group name}                  | The user was bucketed into this experiment group                                                        |
| Abandoned                     | "Make Decision" selected the control group. This experiment has been abandoned.                        |
| {group name} (Launched)       | "Make Decision" selected this group as the launch group, so the user is seeing the launched experience. |
