One of the most common questions we get is "How do I check the experiment group in code?"  Checking the experiment group _in code_ is actually an anti-pattern.
Experiment groups are very useful for understanding what a set of parameters represents in the Statsig console.  Comparing "Sorted Long List" vs "Default Search Results"
is easier to discuss than trying to understand what the `sorted = true, length = 10` parameters represent.

That being said, in code, its much more powerful to directly check parameters and their values. Parameters are the building blocks of your experiments when coding.
Hard coding experiment group names would be both very fragile and very limiting.  Let's see why.

In code, if you tried to use experiment groups, your function might end up looking like this:

```ts
async function getSearchItems(user: StatsigUser, searchTerm: String): String[] {
    const results = index.get(searchTerm);
    const experiment = await statsig.getExperiment(user, 'search_results');
    if (experiment.groupName === 'Sorted Long List') {
      return results.sort().slice(10);
    } else if (experiment.groupName === 'Sorted Short List') {
      return results.sort().slice(3);
    } else {
      return results;
    }
}
```

There are a few problems with this code:

1. Its very fragile.  If the group name in code does not match the name in the Statsig console, you won't return the correct experience
2. Its static.  I can't easily add another experiment group without changing the code.  I cant add an "Unsorted long list" without a code change.

So instead, this is what the code would look like using experiment parameters directly:

```ts
async function getSearchItems(user: StatsigUser, searchTerm: String): String[] {
    let results = index.get(searchTerm);
    const experiment = await statsig.getExperiment(user, 'search_results');
    const sort = experiment.get("sorted", false");
    if (sort) {
      results = results.sort();
    }
    const numItems = experiment.get("length", 0);
    if (numItems > 0) {
      results = results.slice(numItems);
    }
    return results;
}
```

Now, your code is completed decoupled from the names of experiment groups in the statsig console.  You are left with a set of dynamic parameters.
You can create whichever experiment groups you want out of these building blocks, and the same code will work.  Want to test an unsorted list of 5 items
against a sorted list of 20 items?  Just set it up in the Statsig console (and name it whatever you want).

As you can see, experiment groups are very useful for describing a set of parameters.  It makes it easy to compare one group against the other when you
are looking at the results of your experiments.

But when you are coding - stick to the parameters themselves.  It will help you run experiments safely and quickly by making your code fully dynamic.
