# What are Experiments?
Experiments are an experimentation platform that enables you to run randomized controlled experiments to evaluate your software products and features with little to no effort. 

## When to use Experiments
Experiments are ideal for running A/B or A/B/n experiments or when you want to run multiple, mutually exclusive experiments in parallel.
