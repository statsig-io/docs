# What is Experiments+?
Experiments+ is an experimentation platform that enables you to run randomized controlled experiments to evaluate your software products and features with little to no effort. 

## When to use Experiments+
Experiments+ is ideal for running experiments with multiple variants (also known as A/B/n tests) and/or when you want to run multiple, mutually exclusive experiments in parallel. To run a simple A/B test, simply set up a feature gate. Statsig automatically deploys an A/B test for each feature gate you create and computes the results without requiring any additional configuration. 

To learn about all that you can do with Experiments+, see the Statsig tutorial to [working with Experiments+](/experiments-plus/working-with).
