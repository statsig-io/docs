Many features are not listed within the Warehouse Native section since they function near-identically between Cloud and Warehouse Native. These are worth exploring as you integrate with Statsig:
/

- [Feature Gates](/feature-flags/working-with) are a best-in-class tool for managing feature release and targeting. Feature gates with partial rollouts can automatically be analyzed as experiments in Statsig Warehouse Native
- [Session Replay](/session-replay/overview) is a powerful tool for viewing how users interact with your product, giving richer context to changes in user behavior
- [Layers](/layers) allow you to create mutually-exclusive experiments for experiments where changes may collide with other experiments to create a bug or odd result
- [Dynamic Configs](/dynamic-config/working-with) provide server-side configuration tools with optional targeting and integrates naturally with experiments.
- [Admin](/access-management/introduction) tools allow you to control projects, teams, and user access across Statsig
