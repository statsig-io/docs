MEX is Statsig's Analytics solution. With Warehouse Native, this integrates directly on top of your tables to provide easy analysis on the same datasets you're using for experimentation.

## Functionality

### Drill-Down and Filter

Filter and group by fields to calculate measures as timeseries, bar-charts, and more.

### Funnel Analysis

Run powerful and complete funnel analysis to understand how users are moving to your product

### Group By Experiment

View arbitrary timeseries and rollups grouped by experiment membership, allowing more observational analysis of what happened during your experiment.

### Save, Share, and View SQL

Save analyses and share them with coworkers. Viewing the SQL gives you easy access to the queries Statsig ran under the hood, and can be an easy launching-off point for deeper analysis.

## Use it with Replays

MEX naturally dovetails with [Session Replay](/session-replay/overview) to make it easier than ever to understand what's driving the user behavior you measure in your experiments.
