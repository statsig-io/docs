This page has some best practices for data modelling which will be helpful for making queries
run faster and for less cost.

### Cluster/Partition tables to reduce query scope.

We recommend partitioning all of your source tables by date. In warehouses with clustering, we recommend the following strategy:

- Cluster Assignment Source tables by your `experiment_id` column so experiment-level queries can be scoped to just that experiment
- Cluster Metric Source tables based on the fields you expect to use for filters
