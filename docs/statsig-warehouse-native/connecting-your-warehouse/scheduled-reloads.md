## Overview
You can control reloads settings for Metrics and Experiments. While these can be configured on each entity, you can also set defaults that entities can inherit from. You also have the option of using the Console API to [trigger Pulse loads](/console-api/experiments#post-/experiments/-experiment_id-/load_pulse) (experiment results). This is often used in schedule this at the end of data pipelines.
