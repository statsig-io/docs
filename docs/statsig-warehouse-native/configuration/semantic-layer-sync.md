Statsig offers the ability to update its data sources and metrics as part of your data version management flow. This set of scripts automatically syncs changes you make to the matching definitions on Statsig, optionally making the Statsig entities read-only in console.

Please reach out to our [support team](mailto:support@statsig.com) for help integrating this solution.
