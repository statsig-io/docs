# Alerts 
Statsig offers two types of alerts on the platform today:
1. **Rollout Alerts**- These are alerts on a metric's value _in the context of_ a gate or experiment rollout.
2. **Topline Metric Alerts**- These are alerts on a metric's topline value, independent of any experiment or gate. 


Topline Alerts are useful for keeping tabs on topline trends and ensuring you know if key product and business metrics are trending in a concerning direction. Rollout Alerts are helpful to confirm no key metrics are regressing when you start rolling out a new feature or experiment.

NOTE- Topline Alerts are in a limited beta. Please reach out if you would like these enabled for your Project.
