# Alerts 
Statsig offers two types of alerts on the platform today: 
1. **Topline Alerts**- These are alerts on a metric's topline value, independent of any experiment or gate. 
2. **Rollout Alerts**- These are alerts on a metric's value _in the context of_ a gate or experiment rollout.

Topline Alerts are useful for keeping tabs on topline trends and ensuring you know if key product and business metrics are trending in a concerning direction. Rollout Alerts are helpful to confirm no key metrics are regressing when you start rolling out a new feature or experiment.  

NOTE- Topline Alerts are only available on Statsig Cloud right now. Support for Warehouse Native is coming soon.
