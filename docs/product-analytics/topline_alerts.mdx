Topline Alerts notify you when key metrics shift beyond a threshold or change in value. They are available in Statsig Cloud and Statsig Warehouse Native.

Statsig currently supports three types of Topline Alerts:


| Alert Condition Type         | When to Use                          | Example                                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Threshold**     | Use when you want to stay above or below a fixed number. | ‚ÄúAlert me when P90 latency spikes above 15 seconds.‚Äù |
| **Change**        | Use when the absolute size of the change matters. | ‚ÄúAlert me when hourly P90 latency increases by 10 seconds.‚Äù |
| **Change (%)**    | Use when the relative size of the change matters more than raw numbers. | ‚ÄúAlert me when hourly P90 latency increases by 50%.‚Äù |

# Creating a Topline Alert
### **Step 1:** Navigate to Topline Alerts
Go to **Analytics ‚Üí Topline Alerts** in the product menu.  

### **Step 2:** Create a New Alert
Click **+Create** and give the new alert a name.

### **Step 3:** Select the Event or Metric Source
Pick the data you want to monitor.
- **On Statsig Warehouse Native:** Select a Metric Source, filter, and group by your desired dimensions.
- **On Statsig Cloud:** Select the event, aggregation, filters, and group by conditions for this alert.
  
_Example:_ We're going to set set up an alert to monitor P90 latency of `mex_query` events. We're going to filter out internal employee queries and group by an additional dimension called `hadGroupBy`.

### **Step 4:** Review your metric in Alert Preview
The preview shows how your metric is trending with the current setup. Confirm values look correct, or open the metric in [Metrics Explorer](https://docs.statsig.com/product-analytics/drilldown) for deeper analysis.

### **Step 5:** Set Alert Conditions
The preview will update along with your setup changes. Define the:
- Condition type (threshold, change, change %)
- Directionality 
- _"Alert"_ / _"Warn"_ values
- Evaluation window
  - **On Warehouse Native:** Define the evaluation frequency, lookback, and max delay. These will influence the cost of evaluating this alert in your warehouse.

### **Step 6:** Add Notifications
Notifications go to email, the Statsig Console, and Slack if connected. Project-wide defaults are available in the Settings menu. 
- Write a message users will receive when the alert fires (keep it clear and actionable)
- Add subscribers
- Set the alert priority
- Configure re-notification rules if you want alerts to resend while the condition holds


### **Step 7:** Save & Monitor
Save the alert. When it fires, it will appear at the top of the page. From here, you can:
- View samples of the event
- Open the trend in [Metrics Explorer](https://docs.statsig.com/product-analytics/drilldown)
- Mute the alert temporarily if it is noisy or already under investigation

To review past activity, go to the **Diagnostics** tab. This shows alert history with options to inspect samples, launch into Metrics Explorer, or mute.
