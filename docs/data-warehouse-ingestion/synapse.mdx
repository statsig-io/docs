## Overview

To set up connection with Azure Synapse, Statsig needs the following

<b>
Admin user name and password will be used by Statsig to create a user with restricted access to query from your data warehouse.

You can find the this information in your Azure console within your Synapse workspace overview page, as shown in the image below. (Open image in new tab for a bigger image)
