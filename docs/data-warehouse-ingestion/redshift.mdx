## Overview

To set up connection with Redshift, Statsig needs the following

- Cluster Endpoint
- Admin User Name
- Admin User Password

You can find the this information in your aws console within your specific cluster, as shown in the image below. (Open image in new tab for a bigger image)

<b>Admin user name and password will only be used for Statsig to create an admin role with restricted access to query from your data warehouse.</b>

## SSH Tunneling

For Redshift connections, we also allow users to create an SSH tunnel into their Redshift cluster for a more secure and private access to the database.
To enable access, Statsig requires:

- SSH Host
- SSH Port
- SSH User

Statsig will use this information to generate an SSH key. Please add this generated key to your `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on your SSH proxy machine to enable SSH tunneling.
