## Overview

To set up connection with Snowflake, Statsig needs the following

- Account Name
- Database Name
- Schema Name
- Admin User Name
- Admin User Password

<b>
  Your credentials will not be saved or stored; we will only use them to create
  a limited-scope user for ingesting data.
</b>

### Account Name

For the Account Name field, please enter in the format of `<id>.<region>.<provider>`. So, your information may look something like this:

`aa00000.us-central1.gcp`

To get this information navigate to bottom left in your Snowflake console, as shown in the picture below and copy the link URL:

The copied URL will look something like this:

`https://xy12345.us-central1.gcp.snowflakecomputing.com`

You can extract information from here to get the required fields for Account Name, which for this example would be `xy12345.us-central1.gcp`.

### Database and Schema Name

For each data type, provide the database/schema of the table(s) you will be ingesting from.
