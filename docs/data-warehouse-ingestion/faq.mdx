## What IP addresses will Statsig access data warehouses from?

Statsig currently accesses data warehouses from both the Statsig console service and Statsig data pipelines. If your data warehouse is IP protected, please refer to the [Statsig IP range documentation](/infrastructure/statsig_ip_ranges) for IPs to allowlist, and notify us that your warehouse is IP protected on Slack.
