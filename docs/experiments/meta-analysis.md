## The Concept
As teams run a number of experiments, it is possible to glean learning across these experiments. This is meta-analysis. We're rolling out a suite of meta-analysis features this summer - feel free to reach out to help influence our roadmap here. 

## Experiment Timeline View
This view lets you to filter down to experiments a team has run. At a glance you can answer questions like
1. What experiments are running now?
2. When are they expected to end?
3. What % of experiments ship Control vs Test?
4. What is the typical duration?
5. Do experiments run for their planned duration - or much longer or shorter?
6. Do experiments impact key business metrics - or only shallow or team level metrics?
7. How much do they impact key business metrics?

## Metric Insights
This view lets you pick a metric and see all experiments and feature rollouts that impact this metric. [Learn more](https://docs.statsig.com/insights).
