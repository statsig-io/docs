## The Concept
The Experiment Quality Score is a metric designed to get a sense for the quality of an experiment configured within Statsig. It helps experimenters quickly identify potential issues in experiment setup, execution, and data collection, ensuring more confident decision-making. Measuring this over a number of experiments can help measure improvements in maturity over time. 

## Configuring it
You can enable it in Settings -> Experimentation -> Experiment Quality Score. There is a list of pre-defined assessment criteria used. You can customize the weights assigned to each critiera based on relevance to your project.
