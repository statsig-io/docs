#### Environments

By default, all events are treated as "production" events, but you can also differentiate your event traffic by specifying the environment that the events are coming from.
This allows you to avoid non-production data making it into your production metrics.

If you would like to include the environment tier, you can add it to the properties object of your event.
The required format is below:

```json
{
  ...
  "properties": {
   "statsigEnvironment": {
        "tier": "staging"
    }
  }
}
```

To learn more about environments see [Using Environment](/guides/using-environments).
