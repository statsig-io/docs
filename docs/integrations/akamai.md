## Overview
Statsigâ€™s Akamai Edge KV integration pushes Statsig Configs to Edge KV, providing low latency for gate and experiment evaluations directly in Akamai Edge KV. If you have the correct prerequisites - this should take ~60 minutes to get to the point where you are able to check experiments or gates on Akamai.

## Prerequisites
You must have these prerequisites:

1. An Akamai account with [EdgeWorkers added to your contract](https://techdocs.akamai.com/edgeworkers/docs/add-edgeworkers-to-contract) and a Statsig account
2. [The Akamai CLI](https://developer.akamai.com/getting-started/cli)

## Setup Akamai EdgeWorker
1. Create an [EdgeWorker ID](https://techdocs.akamai.com/edgeworkers/docs/create-an-edgeworker-id-1)
2. Add the [EdgeWorker Behavior](https://techdocs.akamai.com/edgeworkers/docs/add-the-edgeworker-behavior-1)
3. Install the [Akamai CLI](https://developer.akamai.com/getting-started/cli)
4. Install the [Edgeworkers CLI](https://techdocs.akamai.com/edgeworkers/docs/akamai-cli#edgeworkers-cli)
5. Generate [EdgeGrid credentials](https://techdocs.akamai.com/developer/docs/edgegrid)

## Configure Integration
First, enable the Akamai integration in the Statsig Console.

Navigate to [Project Settings -> Integrations](https://console.statsig.com/integrations), and then select Akamai

### Authentication
You will need to input the following EdgeGrid credentials from the previous section:

### Configuration
Finalize the configuration by selecting a [namespace](https://techdocs.akamai.com/edgekv/docs/manage-access-to-edgekv) and [environment](https://techdocs.akamai.com/edgekv/docs/sandbox-support-edgekv).

There is also an option to filter the configs that are synced into your KV namespace by a [/sdk-keys/target-apps](Target App).  You may wish to enable this in the future as the size of your config payload grows.  For now, you can leave this unchecked.

![Configuration](https://app.graphite.dev/user-attachments/assets/a2d63315-ab58-496d-901b-10aa6790979f.png)

After filling this out, click **Enable**.

Within a minute, the Statsig backend should generate a config payload from your statsig project and push it into your KV namespace.  Under your KV namespace, navigate to **KV Pairs** - you should see an entry starting with the prefix `statsig-`.  The next part of that is your project ID.  Copy that to the clipboard - you'll need it later.

## Add Statsig SDK to Worker
1. Create a Statsig [server secret key](https://docs.statsig.com/sdk-keys/api-keys/#server-secret-keys) and [configure it on Akamai](https://techdocs.akamai.com/developer/docs/edgegrid#credentials-as-environment-variables)
2. Clone the [Statsig Akamai Edge KV](https://github.com/statsig-io/akamai-statsig-example?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) repo (or if you already have an Edge KV package, apply these changes to it)
3. Follow instructions in the repo
