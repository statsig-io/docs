## Incoming

The Statsig Event Webhook allows you to log event data to Statsig from third party apps or other external sources to provide additional insights to your Statsig experiments and metrics.

Before using the Webhook, you will need to obtain your Projects' [server secret key](/#account-sign-up-and-api-key). An example call to the Statsig Event Webhook should look like the following:

```bash title="HTTP"
POST https://api.statsig.com/v1/webhooks/event_webhook
```

```bash title="Headers"
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: */*
STATSIG-API-KEY: {STATSIG_SERVER_SECRET}
```

```bash title="JSON Body"
{
  "user": {
    "userID": {USER_ID},
    ...
  },
  "event": {EVENT_NAME},
  "value": {VALUE},
  "metadata": {
    "example_field_1": {EXAMPLE_VALUE_1},
    "example_field_2": {EXAMPLE_VALUE_2},
    ...
  },
  timestamp: {TIMESTAMP}
}
```

If you are using a service that we don't have an official integration for, you can always use our Generic Webhook integration.

This integration just sends raw events to the provided webhook url.

### Setup

In your Project Settings, under the Integrations tab. Enable the Generic Webhook integration.

In the dialog that appears, enter the url of you destination webhook and then hit Enable to save the url and enable this integration.

You can then set which events you want forwarded to your webhook using the [Event Filtering](#event-filtering-dialog) dialog.

### Filtering Events

Once you've enabled outbound events to your webhook, you can select which categories of Statsig events you want to export by clicking on the **Event Filtering** button and checking the appropriate boxes as shown below.

### Webhook Signature

You can verify that a webhook request is coming from Statsig via our Webhook Signature. 

Follow the following steps to verify the signature:

1. Grab your webhook signing secret from your Webhook integration card

2. Extract the request time header 'X-Statsig-Request-Timestamp' from the webhook request.
3. Concatenate the version number ("v0"), the timestamp, and the request body together, using a colon (:) as a delimiter to create a signature basestring. Here's an example of a possible base string:

```
v0:1671672194836:{"data":[{"user":{"name":"Joe Zeng","email":"joe@statsig.com"},"timestamp":1671672134833,"eventName":"statsig::config_change","metadata":{"type":"Gate","name":"test","description":"- Updated Rule test rollout from 100.00% to 10.00%","environment":"production"}}]}
```

4. Hash the signature basestring, using the signing secret as a key, and take the hex digest of the hash. Create the full signature by prefixing the hex digest with the version number ("v0") and an equals sign. See sample psuedo code below.

```
statsig_signature = 'v0=' + hmac.compute_hash_sha256(
webhook_signing_secret,
signature_basestring
).hexdigest()
>>> 'v0=05c50d1513d49f884df8b0469befbbd432bd30364e81f16a606dec69f29e8f18'
```

5. Compare the resulting signature to the 'X-Statsig-Signature' header on the request
