## Overview

Enabling the Segment integration for Statsig will allow Statsig to pull in your Segment events. This allows you to run your experiment analysis on Statsig with all of your existing events from Segment without requiring any additional logging.

When Statsig receives events from Segment, these will be visible and aggregated in the [Metrics](/metrics) tab in the Statsig console. These events will automatically be included in your [Pulse](/pulse) results for A/B tests with Statsig's feature gates as well as all your [Experiment](/experiments-plus/monitor) results.

## Configuring Incoming Events

To ingest your events from Segment,

1. In the Segment App, click **Add Destination** in the Destinations catalog page.
2. Search for “Statsig” in the Destinations Catalog, and select the “Statsig” destination.
3. Choose which Source should send data to the “Statsig” destination.
4. From the [Statsig dashboard](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys), copy the Statsig "Server Secret Key”.
5. Enter the Statsig “Server Secret Key” in the “Statsig” destination settings in Segment.
6. On the Statsig [Integration page](https://console.statsig.com/integrations) enable the Segment integration.
7. As your Segment events flow into Statsig, you'll see a live **Log Stream** in the [Metrics](/metrics) tab in the Statsig console. You can click one of these events to see the details that are logged as part of the event.

#### User IDs and Custom IDs

Statsig automatically detects the `event` and `userId` fields that you log through your Segment [`track`](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) event. If you're running an experiment with the user as your unit type, this userID should match the user identifer that you log with the Statsig SDK, for example when you expose the the user to a Statsig feature gate or experiment.

If you're using a [custom ID](https://docs.statsig.com/guides/experiment-on-custom-id-types) as the unit type for your experiment, you can provide this identifier using the key `statsigCustomIDs` as part of the Segment `properties` field as shown below.

```bash title="JSON Body"
{
  ...
  properties: {
    "statsigCustomIDs": [ "companyID", "<this_company_id>", "stableID", "<this_stable_id>",]
  }
}
```

The `statsigCustomIDs` field in properties should be an array, where the even index is the name of the user ID type and the odd index is the value of the previous element in the array. Assuming you've created this custom ID type on Statsig (under **ID Type Settings** in your [Project Settings](https://console.statsig.com/settings)), Statsig will automatically recognize these custom identifiers to compute your experiment results appropriately.

#### Syncing Statsig Segment ID Lists with Segment Personas Audiences

By using [Segment Personas Audiences](https://segment.com/docs/personas/audiences/) you are able to maintain a list of users that can be used for targeting using [Statsig Feature Gates](/feature-gates). To configure this:

1. Create a [Statsig ID List Segment](/segments/create-new) on the Statsig Console.
2. Follow the [Segment guide for Audiences](https://segment.com/docs/personas/audiences/) to create a new Audience and choose `Statsig` as a Destination. The `audience_key` must match the ID of the `Statsig ID List Segment` created.

Once these steps have been completed, your Segment Audience will be synced, and you will be able to target those users for features you develop or experiments you run.

## Configuring Outbound Events

To export your Statsig events to Segment,

1. Log into the Statsig console and navigate to the [**Integrations**](https://console.statsig.com/integrations) page.
2. Click on the **Segment** card and switch to the **Outbound** tab, copy your [Segment write key](https://segment.com/docs/getting-started/02-simple-install/#find-your-write-key), paste into the **API Key** text box shown below, and click **Enable**.

## Filtering Events

You can customize which events should be sent and received via Segment using [Event Filtering](/integrations/event_filtering)
