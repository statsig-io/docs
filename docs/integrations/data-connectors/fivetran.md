## Overview

Enabling the Fivetran integration for Statsig will allow Statsig to push events to your Fivetran account through a webhook. This allows you to forward Statsig data to any connectors available from Fivetran.

## Configuring Outbound Events

1. Follow the steps in the [Fivetran Webhook Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/events/webhooks/setup-guide) to create a new Webhook URL.
2. On the Statsig [Integrations](https://console.statsig.com/integrations) page, enable the Fivetran integration by pasting in the Fivetran Webhook URL and click **Confirm**.
