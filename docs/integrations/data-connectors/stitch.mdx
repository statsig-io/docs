## Overview

Enabling the Stitch integration for Statsig will allow Statsig to push events to your Stitch account through a webhook. This allows you to forward Statsig data to any connectors available from Stitch.

## Configuring Outbound Events

1. Follow the steps in the [Stitch Webhook Setup Guide](https://www.stitchdata.com/docs/integrations/webhooks/stitch-incoming-webhooks#setup) to create a new Webhook URL.
2. On the Statsig [Integrations](https://console.statsig.com/integrations) page, enable the Stitch integration by pasting in the Stitch Webhook URL and click **Confirm**.
