## Overview

Statsig supports both incoming outgoing events for Amplitude. As well as adding Amplitude Cohorts to Statsig ID Lists.

## Incoming - Receiving Events From Amplitude

The following steps outline how to forward events from Amplitude into Statsig.

1. Get a Statsig "Server Secret Key" from the API keys page in [Project Settings](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).

2. Go to Amplitude and navigate to the Data Destinations page. Click the
   "Add Destination" button in the top right.

3. From the Destinations Catalog, search for and select the Statsig Event
   Streaming destination.

5. Enter the "Server Secret Key" you copied in Step 1 into the provided
   field. Select the events you wish to send to Statsig. Ensure that the
   Status is set to "Enabled" and then click "Save".

## Filtering Events

You can customize which events should be sent and received via RudderStack using [Event Filtering](/integrations/event_filtering)
