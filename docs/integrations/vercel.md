title: Vercel Edge Config
---

## Overview
Statsigâ€™s Vercel integration pushes Statsig Configs to Vercel's Edge Config, allowing you to bootstrap your Vercel projects quickly.

## Configuration
Go to the [Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations/statsig-edge-config) to install the Statsig app for Vercel. In the setup, you'll be able to map Statsig projects <-> Edge Configs, and Statsig will keep project configs synced with the specified Edge Config.

After setting up the mapping, you'll be given an Edge Config Connection String, which should be saved to the EDGE_CONFIG environment variable in your Vercel project. You can read your Statsig configs from the Edge Config Item Key provided. See https://github.com/joe-statsig/vercel-integration for a sample project.

After setting up the configuration, you can go to Project Settings -> Integrations and click on the Vercel Card to go to an integration configuration page for the project.
