## Project Notifications
To configure project notifications go to [Integrations](https://console.statsig.com/integrations).<br />
Once enabled, you can opt-in to optional notifications like [Health Checks](https://docs.statsig.com/statsig-warehouse-native/guides/pulse#health-checks) and Statsig system [Status Reports](https://status.statsig.com/).<br />
You can also filter change updates by the environment affected.
