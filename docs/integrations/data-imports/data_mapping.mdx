title: Data Mapping
---

## Overview

Statsig requires certain data schema in order for proper processing. We support 3 different types of datasets to be ingested into our platform:

1. Custom Events
2. Precomputed Metrics
3. Exposure Events (Coming Soon)

During setup, we will ask you to map columns in your data output to fields Statsig expects and run a small sample query to make sure that there aren't any basic issues with data types, the mapping, or the base query itself.

Please note that we will cast fields into the appropriate type. For example, Statsig accepts String IDs, but it's okay to leave an ID field as an integer.

### Custom Events

Events that are emitted by your application to measure the ongoing impact of your features and experiments.

#### Required

| Column     | Description                            | Format/Rules                                                                     |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| time_stamp | The unix time your event was logged at | BIGINT; please cast timestamps into timezoneless unix time                       |
| event_name | The name of the event                  | STRING/VARCHAR. Not null. Length < 128 characters                                |
| unit_id    | Unique unit identifier                 | STRING/VARCHAR User ID, Stable ID, etc. The same event row can have multiple IDs |

#### Optional

| Column         | Description                      | Rules                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| event_value    | The value of the event           | STRING/VARCHAR Length < 128 characters. Statsig will detect numeric values                                       |
| event_metadata | Metadata columns about the event | (MANY) STRING:STRING. Statsig will generate a metadata json field from however many metadata columns you provide |
| metadata_json  | Metadata json about the event    | JSON STRING. Statsig will unpack this json 1 level deep. Nested values will be stored as strings                 |

### Precomputed Metrics

Precomputed metrics are a powerful way to leverage statsig for experiment results. Use these to send complex metrics and metrics that require delays due to attribution windows or long baking periods.

Precomputed metrics in statsig are expected to be calculated at a user-day granularity.

#### Required

| Column       | Description                                                                                                                   | Format/Rules                                                                                                                                                     |

| unit_id      | The unique user identifier this metric is for.
