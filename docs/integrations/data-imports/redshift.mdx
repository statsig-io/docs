title: Redshift
---

## Overview

There are 2 ways to integrate with Redshift: using a data connector, or ingesting events and metrics to Statsig through S3.

## Using a Data Connector

To **ingest** events from Redshift, you can use our [Census integration](/integrations/data-connectors/census).

To **export** events to Redshift, you can use our [Fivetran integration](/integrations/data-connectors/fivetran).

## Direct Ingestion

S3 imports are currently a custom setup flow. You'll need to reach out to Statsig through Slack or through your support PoC in order to set up this integration.
The documentation below describes the steps to set up this integration. There are 3 main steps:

1. Create a pipeline to write your metric, event, and (optionally) signal data to an S3 bucket in parquet format

2. Create an IAM user with read and list access on that bucket and send that user's Key/Secret to Statsig. We will securely store these in a keystore service

3. Schedule ingestion through a `signals` dataset or through the `mark_data_ready` API

### Set up a data pipeline to S3

#### Filesystem Format

We will expect data in your S3 bucket to be saved in parquet format.

To allow for daily uploads, please set up your bucket with the following folders:

- `events/` for events data
- `metrics/` for metrics data
- `signals/` for signal flags when you've finished uploading data for a day. You can omit this folder and instead use the [`mark_data_ready` API](/metrics/ingest) instead, but you must use one or the other

We recommend writing folders by date partitions for ease of debugging, i.e. storing day's data in folders with ISO-formatted names (`YYYY-MM-DD`).

#### Data Format

Please make sure your data conforms to the following schemas.

<b>Events</b>

| Column         | Description                                                                                                       | Rules                                                                                                   |

| event_name     | The name of the event                                                                                             | String under 128 characters, using `_` for spaces                                                       |
| event_value    | A string representing the value of a current event. Can represent a 'dimension' or a 'value'                      | Read as string format; numeric values will be converted into value                                      |
| event_metadata | A dictionary<string, string> in the form of a JSON string, containing named metadata for the event                | String format. Not null. Length < 128 characters                                                        |
| user           | A JSON object representing the user this event was logged for; see below                                          | Escaped JSON string including the keys 'custom' and 'customIDs'. A userID or customID must be provided. |
| timeuuid       | A unique UUID or timeUUID used for deduping. If omitted, will be generated but will not be effective for deduping | UUID format                                                                                             |

Please refer to docs for the [Statsig User Object](https://docs.statsig.com/client/concepts/user#user-attributes) for available fields. An example would look like:

```
{
  userID: "12345",
  customIDs: {
    stableID: "<device_id_here>",
    ...
  }
  email: "12345@gmail.com",

  custom: {
    new_user: "false",
    age: "22"
    ...
  },
}
```

<b>Metrics</b>

Make sure to include all of metric_value, numerator, and denominator, writing `cast(null as double)` for numerator and denominator if you are omitting them (or conversely for metric_value if sending numerator/denominator).

| Column       | Description                                                                                                                   | Rules                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| unit_id      | The unique user identifier this metric is for. This might not necessarily be a user_id - it could be a custom_id of some kind | String format. Make sure this is in the same format as your logged unit_ids                                                                                                                                                                  |
| id_type      | The id_type the unit_id represents.                                                                                           | String format. Must be a valid id_type. The default Statsig types are user_id/stable_id, but you may have generated custom id_types. Make sure this matches (case sensitive) a customID in your project, or you won't get experiment results |
| date         | Date of the daily metric                                                                                                      | Read as string format; can be written as ISO date. Statsig's dates are calculated in PST - we'll load custom metrics to whatever date you use here                                                                                           |

| metric_value | A numeric value for the metric                                                                                                | Double format. Metric value, or both of numerator/denominator need to be provided for Statsig to process the metric. See details below                                                                                                       |

If present along with a denominator in any record, the metric will be treated as ratio and only calculated for users with non-null denominators                                                   |
| denominator  | Denominator for metric calculation                                                                                            | Double format.

### Set up and Provide Credentials

- Navigate to your IAM console on AWS
- Go to Users->Add User
- Select the `Access key - Programmatic access` credential type
- Attach an appropriate policy which gives Read and List access to the appropriate bucket. Make sure this is scoped appropriately so the user only has access to the data intended!
  Example policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": "<BUCKET_ARN>"
        }
    ]
}
```

Next, modify your bucket access policy (under `permissions` on your S3 bucket's page) to allows this user to access objects.
Example policy:

```
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "statement1",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": {
				"AWS": "<IAM_ARN>"
			},
			"Action": "s3:ListBucket",
			"Resource": "<BUCKET_ARN>"
		},
		{
			"Sid": "statement2",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": {
				"AWS": "<IAM_ARN>"
			},
			"Action": "s3:GetObject",
			"Resource": "<BUCKET_ARN>/*"
		}
	]
}
```

You can confirm your credentials are sufficient by adding any data to your metrics folder and running the following code in PySpark with the IAM user credentials:

```
sc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set("fs.s3n.awsAccessKeyId", '<IAM_USER_ACCESS_KEY>')
sc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set("fs.s3n.awsSecretAccessKey", '<IAM_USER_SECRET>')
spark.read.parquet("s3://<BUCKET_NAME>/metrics/*",inferSchema=True).show()
```

### Scheduling

Because you may be streaming events to your tables or have multiple ETLs pointing to your metrics table, Statsig relies on you signalling that your metric/events for a given day are done.

To do this, write a dataset with the single column `finished_date`, which contains all dates of data which have been written to Statsig. For example, once you have written data for `2022-06-22` you would insert a record with `finished_date` of `2022-06-22` to trigger ingestion of data from up to and including `2022-06-22`.

Unlike some other integrations like Snowflake, for S3 Statsig will skip dates; if your latest finished date is `2022-06-22` and you insert `2022-07-01`, we will ingest all data as of `2022-07-01` and infer that data for dates between (e.g. `2022-06-25`) is loaded.

Alternatively, you can use the `mark_data_ready` API and send a timestamp for which the data previous to that timestamp has finished loading into S3.
