title: Redshift

## Overview

There are 2 ways to integrate with Redshift: using a data connector, or through ingestion via a blob store from Redshift.

## Using a Data Connector

To **ingest** events from Redshift, you can use our [Census integration](/integrations/data-connectors/census).

To **export** events to Redshift, you can use our [Fivetran integration](/integrations/data-connectors/fivetran).

## Direct ingestion from Redshift
Upload your pre-computed metrics data to [Azure Blob Storage](azure_upload) and have Statsig ingest them.
