## Overview

The BigQuery integration allows you to export events and/or metrics from your BigQuery instance to Statsig.
Here are the 3 steps to take to enable BigQuery integration with Statsig:

1. Set up tables in your BigQuery instance.

2. Give Statsig's service account corresponding permissions on the tables.

3. Insert data into tables and mark data to be ready for import.

## Set Up Tables in your BigQuery instance {#setup}

1. In your project, create a new dataset where tables for Statsig should live.

2. Create a table for pre-computed metrics.

3. Create a table for signal.

## Give permissions to Statsig's service account {#permissions}

1. In your Statsig console, navigate to Project Settings -> Integrations -> BigQuery. Here you will see the Statsig service account. Copy it to be used later.

2. In your BigQuery's [IAM & Admin settings](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/), add the Statsig service account you copied in step 1 as a new principal for your project, and give it "BigQuery Read Session User" role.

3. Navigate to your [BigQuery SQL Workspace](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery), choose the dataset, click on "+ Sharing" -> "Permissions" -> "Add Principal" to give the same Statsig service account "BigQuery Data Viewer" role on the dataset.

4. Back to your Statsig console's BigQuery integration dialog, and enter your BigQuery project and dataset name. Then click "Enable".

Now the service account should have the required permissions to export data from this dataset.

## Insert data for import and let us know

Now that everything is set up, shoot us a message on [Slack](https://www.statsig.com/slack) if you have any questions. We can also help making sure everything is set up correctly for you.
