title: BigQuery 
---
## Overview

There are 2 ways to integrate with BigQuery: using a data connector, or through direct ingestion from BigQuery.

## Using a Data Connector

To **ingest** events from BigQuery, you can use our [Census integration](/integrations/data-connectors/census).

To **export** events to BigQuery, you can use our [Fivetran integration](/integrations/data-connectors/fivetran).

## Direct ingestion from BigQuery
A native integration with BigQuery is coming soon. In the interim you can upload your pre-computed metrics data to [Azure Blob Storage](azure_upload) and have Statsig ingest them.
