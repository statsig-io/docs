# Web Analytics Overview

[Web analytics](https://www.statsig.com/web-analytics) lets you track and watch key measures for your website easily. It is different from product analytics because it's simpler and more direct, making it great for marketers, web site maintainers, or anyone familiar with tools like Google Analytics. 

With Web Analytics and Statsig Dashboards you can easily gather insights such as number of visitors, views, sessions, how long sessions last, error rates, usage journey, and more.

# Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get started with Web Analytics.

## Option 1: HTML Script Installation

The simplest way to get started is by adding a single script tag to your website:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@statsig/js-client@3/build/statsig-js-client+session-replay+web-analytics.min.js?apikey=[YOUR_CLIENT_KEY]"></script>
```

Get YOUR_CLIENT_KEY from Project Settings -> Keys & Environments. Reveal the Client API Key, copy, and paste it over the [YOUR_CLIENT_KEY] in the snippet above.

## Option 2: HTML Script with Advanced Control

For more control over initialization and configuration, you can manually initialize the Statsig client:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@statsig/js-client@3/build/statsig-js-client+session-replay+web-analytics.min.js"></script>
<script>
  const { StatsigClient, StatsigAutoCapturePlugin, StatsigSessionReplayPlugin } = window.Statsig;

  const client = new StatsigClient(
    'YOUR_CLIENT_KEY',       // put your client sdk key here - "client-XXXX"
    { userID: 'optional' },  // set a userID here if you have one
    { plugins: [
      new StatsigAutoCapturePlugin(),
      new StatsigSessionReplayPlugin()
    ]}
  ); 

  client.initializeAsync().catch((err) => console.error(err));
</script>
```

## Option 3: JavaScript Client SDK (React)

For React applications, you can use the React bindings with the web analytics plugin:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';

import { StatsigProvider } from '@statsig/react-bindings';
import { StatsigAutoCapturePlugin } from '@statsig/web-analytics';

  return (
    <StatsigProvider
      sdkKey={YOUR_CLIENT_KEY}
      user={{ userID: 'a-user' }}
      loadingComponent={
        <div style={{ height: 100, width: 300, padding: 16 }}>Loading...</div>
      }
      options={{ plugins: [ new StatsigAutoCapturePlugin() ] }}>
      <div>Hello</div>
    </StatsigProvider>
  );
```

## Release your changes

Once your changes are live, you'll start to see the events flowing in your metrics page: https://console.statsig.com/metrics/events

# Autocaptured Events

Statsig Web Analytics automatically captures the following events without any additional code:

## Page Navigation Events
- **`auto_capture::page_view`** - Triggered when a user navigates to a new page. Includes page URL, query parameters, referrer information, and metadata.
- **`auto_capture::page_view_end`** - Triggered when a user leaves a page. Includes engagement metrics like scroll depth, time on page, and whether the exit was due to inactivity.

## User Interaction Events  
- **`auto_capture::click`** - Captures all click events with target element information, coordinates, and page context.
- **`auto_capture::rage_click`** - Detects rapid repeated clicks in the same area, often indicating user frustration.
- **`auto_capture::dead_click`** - Identifies clicks that don't result in any page changes or navigation, potentially indicating broken functionality.
- **`auto_capture::form_submit`** - Captures form submission events with form metadata.
- **`auto_capture::copy`** - Tracks when users copy text from your page, including the selected text content.

## Technical Performance Events
- **`auto_capture::error`** - Automatically captures JavaScript errors with stack traces, error messages, and context.
- **`auto_capture::performance`** - Collects page load performance metrics including load times, DOM interactive time, and network transfer data.
- **`auto_capture::web_vitals`** - Captures Core Web Vitals metrics (see Web Vitals section below).

## Session Events
- **`auto_capture::session_start`** - Marks the beginning of a new user session.

## Console Logging (Disabled by Default)
- **`statsig::log_line`** - Captures console log output when explicitly enabled. This event is disabled by default and must be configured to activate.

For more in-depth breakdown of auto capture event data, refer to [Autocapture on the Web](/webanalytics/autocapture)

# Event Filtering and Console Configuration

## Disabling Events via Console

You can disable specific autocapture events from the Statsig console under Project Settings > Analytics & Session Replay:

![screenshot_2024-09-16_at_8 05 21___am](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cba9cbc-9fbe-4024-9a7f-43184efc37b9)

## Programmatic Event Filtering

For more granular control, you can filter events programmatically using a custom filter function:

```javascript
const client = new StatsigClient(
  'YOUR_CLIENT_KEY',
  { userID: 'optional' },
  { plugins: [
    new StatsigAutoCapturePlugin({
      eventFilterFunc: (event) => {
        // Return false to prevent logging this event
        if (event.metadata.pageUrl === 'https://example.com/admin') {
          return false; // Don't send events from admin pages
        }
        return true; // Allow all other events
      }
    })
  ]}
);
```

## Console Log Capture Configuration

Console log capture is disabled by default but can be enabled with the following configuration:

```javascript
const client = new StatsigClient(
  'YOUR_CLIENT_KEY',
  { userID: 'optional' },
  { plugins: [
    new StatsigAutoCapturePlugin({
      consoleLogAutoCaptureSettings: {
        enabled: true,                    // Enable console log capture
        logLevel: 'info',                // Minimum log level: 'trace', 'debug', 'log', 'info', 'warn', 'error'
        sampleRate: 0.1                  // Optional: capture 10% of logs (0.0 to 1.0)
      }
    })
  ]}
);
```


# Web Vitals Events

Statsig automatically captures Core Web Vitals metrics that are essential for measuring user experience and SEO performance:

## The Four Core Web Vitals

- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)** - Measures visual stability by tracking unexpected layout shifts during page load. Lower scores indicate better user experience.

- **FCP (First Contentful Paint)** - Measures loading performance by tracking when the first text or image is painted on the screen. Faster FCP times indicate better perceived performance.

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)** - Measures loading performance by tracking when the largest content element becomes visible. This metric correlates strongly with user-perceived load times.

- **TTFB (Time to First Byte)** - Measures server response time by tracking how long it takes to receive the first byte of response from the server. This indicates server and network performance.

These metrics are automatically collected and sent as `auto_capture::web_vitals` events, providing insights into your website's performance and user experience quality.

# Single Page Application (SPA) Support

Statsig Web Analytics automatically supports single page applications without any additional configuration. The system intelligently detects route changes through:

## Automatic Route Change Detection

- **Browser Navigation**: Listens for `popstate` events to detect when users use browser back/forward buttons
- **Programmatic Navigation**: Automatically proxies `history.pushState` calls to detect when your application programmatically navigates to new routes
- **Automatic Page Views**: Triggers new `auto_capture::page_view` events whenever route changes are detected

This means that modern SPA frameworks like React Router, Vue Router, Angular Router, and others work seamlessly with Statsig Web Analytics without requiring manual page view tracking.

# Exploring using Metrics Explorer

In [Metrics Explorer](https://console.statsig.com/metrics/explore), you can dig deeper and explore your events by using complex filters and dimensions.  You can then explore your analysis to your dashboard.

More information on using Metrics Explorer like [Funnels and Retention is here](/product-analytics/overview).

You can see some example autocapture event details [here](/webanalytics/autocapture).

# Advanced Setup

If you need to add additional configurations, metadata about the user, or want to access the full `StatsigClient` to check feature gates and experiments or log events, you can used the advanced setup.  The script tag above will automatically initialize the SDK, but if you remove your SDK key you can manually configure your integration.
