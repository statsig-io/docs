Pulse is Statsig's powerful visualization that shows an experiment's impact across a wide range of metrics. It allows you to quickly assess which metrics you need to pay attention to, while finding trends across metrics, allowing you to validate existing hypotheses or devise alternative explanations. Pulse is currently available on partially rolled out feature gates and Experiments+.

Statsig believes that experimentation should never be reduced to a single metric and that it's critical to understand the effect of changes and experiments across a suite of your company's metrics. Examining more than one metric allows you to find corroborating data about how and why an experiment works. It can also help you identify potential issues, tradeoffs, and unintended consequences. This powerful approach to experimentation was pioneered and proven by some of the largest tech companies.
