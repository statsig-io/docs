## What is a Prompt in Statsig?
A Prompt is a way to represent an LLM prompt or a task in Statsig, with it's config. Prompts are similar to Dynamic Configs, and allow you to evaluate and roll out prompts in production without deploying code. 

With Prompts, you can 
- Manage your prompt configuration outside of your application code. You can update model, configuration or prompt at runtime. 
- Team mates who have access to Statsig can collaborate and iterate on prompts, while benefitting from Statsig's production change control processes and versioning. 
- Add configuration for a new model, model provider and progressively shift production traffic to this while comparing costs, user satisfaction or any metric of interest. 
- Support advanced use cases such as
   - retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and
   - evaluation in production.
