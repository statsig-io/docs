## Offline evals in 10 minutes
**1. Create a Prompt within Statsig**
This captures the instruction you provide to an LLM to accomplish your task. You can now use the Statsig Node or Python Server Core SDKs to retrieve this prompt within your app and use it. 
>> Translate user input from English to French. Input : '{{input}}'

**2. Eval Step 1: Create a dataset you can use to evaluate LLM completions for your prompt**
For the example above, this might be a list of words, along side known good translations in French. Small lists can be entered (or upload a CSV).

**3. Eval Step 2: Create a grader that will grade LLM completions for your prompt**
Configure a grader that compares the LLM completion text with the reference output. You can use one of the out of box string evaluators, or even configure an LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator that mimics a human's grading rubric.

**3. Eval Step 3: Run evaluation**
Run an evaluation on a version of the prompt. You should see results in a few minutes that look like this. You can click into any row of the dataset to understand more about the evaluation for that row.
