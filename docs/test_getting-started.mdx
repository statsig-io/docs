Statsig is the world’s most advanced experimentation platform. It enables your entire company to run experiments collaboratively and quickly, with minimal engineering effort.

There are two ways to seamlessly integrate Statsig into your product development:

- **Statsig Cloud:** Set up ***Statsig SDK***, configure **events logging**. Everything else is handled by us.
    - You get feature gates and 1 million metered events for free, as well as many analytics tools such as Dashboard, Metrics Explorer, and Insights. Here is [a link](https://www.statsig.com/pricing) to our pricing details.
- **Warehouse Native:** If the events or metrics you want to experiment on are already in your warehouse, you may want to consider [Warehouse Native](https://docs.statsig.com/statsig-warehouse-native/introduction) (WHN).
    - With WHN, you can host Statsig’s Stats Engine within your own Data Warehouse, calculating metric lifts on your own datasets. This is particularly useful for teams with strong privacy constraints.
    - You can use non-Statsig SDKs for feature assignment and provide us exposures in a table (you randomize), or use our SDKs (we randomize and write into your warehouse). The former helps you scale analysis; the latter helps you [10x experimentation velocity](https://www.statsig.com/blog/features-to-10x-experiment-velocity).
    - Today’s this option is only available with Enterprise contracts. Check [this link](https://docs.statsig.com/statsig-warehouse-native/introduction) for more details or [Schedule a demo](https://www.statsig.com/contact/demo) with our sales team.

This page gives you an organized overview of how to set up the SDK. SDK can help you log events, and assignments, which will light up **feature gate**, **experiments**, and **analytics** within half an hour.


# Overview: What is Statsig, and what is needed to set it up?

Statsig provides three tightly-integrated core capabilities:

1. **Experimentation**: Run **AB tests** with minimal engineering efforts (two lines of code), and make decisions as a team with a powerful and intuitive **Console.**
2. **Feature Gating**: **Decouple code deployment** and **feature deployment,** giving you **full control** of your users’ experiences, including the ability to rollout or rollback features in a single click.
3. **User Analytics**: Dashboards, charts, funnels, retention; from logged events to all sorts of business metrics.

Statsig helps you generate two core outputs — **metrics** and **exposures** — metrics summarizes user behaviors that are meaningful to your business; exposure tells us, and allows us to control, what features each user is exposed to.

**Logging Events** is the foundation for **metrics**, and **Feature assignment** is the foundation for **exposures**. Statsig has best-in-class **SDKs** built with experimentation as a first-class citizen, that once turned on, can create logging events and feature assignments to power all Statsig features. The SDK is strongly recommended for as it’s reliable, resilient, and have many experimentation best practices built in.

*You can use Statsig without its SDK. For example, **metrics** can come from raw events table, metric definitions, or a precomputed metrics table; **assignments** can come from 3rd party tool, or in-house assignment tool. Statsig is modulated to work with other tools you are currently using.*

Now, let’s walk through how to use Statsig SDK to turn on events logging.

# Three Steps to Turn on Statsig Cloud

## Step 1. Integrate with our SDK
export const ArrowButton = ({ link }) => (
  <IconButton
    style={{
      color: "#194b7d",
      border: "1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)",

      padding: "4px",

    >
      arrow_forward
    </Icon>
  </IconButton>
);

export const SDKCard = ({ language, image, link }) => (

We also provide an HTTP API. Our API is a great choice if an SDK isn't
available for your environment yet, as you can use it in any type of
application:

## Step 2. Set Up Your First Feature Gate

Check [this page](https://docs.statsig.com/guides/first-feature) for a full walkthrough

![fg_setup](https://github.com/statsig-io/docs/assets/139815787/4a320c20-c060-4dc2-a493-178f9e7855e9)

## Step 3. Start Logging Events

Check [this page](https://docs.statsig.com/guides/logging-events) for a full walkthrough

![logging_setup](https://github.com/statsig-io/docs/assets/139815787/219f2980-6bae-418d-896a-1305d5bb52c2)

## Hooray!

Now, **events** are **logged** and passed to Statsig Cloud via the SDK. They will start being computed as metrics in your ***Metrics Catalog***:

![metrics](https://github.com/statsig-io/docs/assets/139815787/f810a6e4-eca8-4ed4-be96-76f134f14397)

Which you can add to a [***Dashboard***](https://docs.statsig.com/metrics):

![dashboard](https://github.com/statsig-io/docs/assets/139815787/cd6b2f71-8ca0-4d77-8d7c-a2b081bbbc8e)

Or even start trying to optimize via ***Experiments***:

![experiment](https://github.com/statsig-io/docs/assets/139815787/cf61372a-9429-4594-936b-dfea825eacd9)
