Statsig provides a comprehensive set of SDKs to integrate experimentation, feature flagging, and logging into your applications. With support for over **30 platforms**, Statsig’s SDKs enable you to control feature rollouts and experiments seamlessly, whether you're building for **web**, **mobile**, or **server-side** environments.

## Why Use Statsig SDKs?

Statsig SDKs are designed to provide two key functionalities that help you make data-driven product decisions:

### 1. **Targeting & Assignment**
Effortlessly manage who sees new features and which users are assigned to experiment variants. You can target based on any **user attributes** (e.g., location, device type) or **environment-level attributes** you log. This lets you control the feature rollout experience and experiment assignments dynamically.

### 2. **Logging Events**
Automatically log user actions and system events for in-depth analysis. The event logs feed into Statsig’s platform to generate key **metrics** for your experiments and features, which can be analyzed in the **Statsig Console**.

For web-based platforms (e.g., JavaScript, React), Statsig also supports:
- **[Autocaptured Events for Web Analytics](/webanalytics/overview)**: Automatically track user interactions without manual instrumentation.
- **[Session Replay](/session-replay/overview)**: Capture detailed session recordings to better understand how users interact with your product.

## Choosing the Right SDK: Client vs. Server

Statsig offers both **client-side** and **server-side** SDKs, each suited to different use cases:

- **Client-Side SDKs**: Designed for user-facing applications where events are logged directly from the browser or mobile app. These SDKs work in real-time, providing instant feedback on user behavior.
  
- **Server-Side SDKs**: Ideal for backend services, allowing you to control experiments, feature flags, and log server-side events. Server-side SDKs offer more control, especially for use cases involving system-level actions or business logic.

For a detailed comparison, refer to the [Client vs Server SDK Overview](/sdks/client-vs-server).

Additionally, for frameworks like **Next.js** that bridge client and server-side logic, we offer specialized SDKs like the [Next.js SDK](/client/javascript-sdk/next-js) for seamless integration.

## Next Steps: Installing Your SDK

1. **Select Your SDK**: Choose the client or server SDK that fits your platform from the lists above.
2. **Follow the Installation Guide**: Each SDK has an installation guide that walks you through the setup, ensuring a smooth integration with your app.
3. **Start Experimenting**: Once integrated, you can begin setting up feature flags, running experiments, and logging events for analysis.
