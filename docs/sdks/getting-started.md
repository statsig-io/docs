## Configuration Options
Statsig offers 20+ SDKs, with both client-side and server-side SDK options. At their core, Statsig’s SDKs enable two key functions: 
1. **Targeting & Assignment-** Assigning users to an experiment variant or targeting new feature roll-outs based on a user’s attributes. Target with any user or environment-level attribute you log.  
2. **Logging-** Log events for user or system-level actions, which are translated into computed Metrics for analysis within your Statsig Console.

Our web (javascript, react) SDKs also support [autocaptured events for web analytics](/webanalytics/overview), and [session replay](/session-replay/overview).

You can [learn more here](/sdks/client-vs-server) about the differences between client and server-side SDKs.
