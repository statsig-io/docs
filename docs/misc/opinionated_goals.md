There’s a lot of different ways to use Statsig and a lot of different company sizes with different requirements for what using us successfully looks like.

| **5-20 People**                        | Consider enabling reviews to get a second set of eyes on changes                               | Default roles still work, but can restrict self-approvals to Admins                                       | No formal team structure needed                                                                                       | Yes                                                                                                               |
| **Larger Teams (20-100 People)**       | Reviews should be enabled to improve accountability                                            | Consider breaking out **Member** role into **Member (Data)** and **Member (Engineering)** to separate control over metrics vs. end-user changes | Start adding in the Teams feature to make it easier to track down who owns what, if not enforcing standards per team | Yes                                                                                                               |
