# What are Layers?
Layers allow us to create experiments that are mutually exclusive. That is to say, users that are in one experiment of a layer, cannot also be in another experiment in the same layer.

Layers also allow the sharing of parameters across experiments. They are a 'write code once' solution to experimentation, allowing iteration on experiments without client side code changes.


To learn about all that you can do with Layers, see the Statsig tutorial [on Layers in JS](/layers/js-tutorial).
