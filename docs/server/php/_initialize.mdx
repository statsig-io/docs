There is also a parameter `options` that requires you to pass in a storage adapter for storing configurations and event logs. In this below example, we use a local file storage adapter, but you can write your own to plug in Redis or another storage solution. Create an adapter that implements `Statsig\Adapters\IConfigAdapter` if you do not want to use the local file storage adapter.

```java
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php'; // path to installation folder

use Statsig\StatsigServer;
use Statsig\StatsigOptions;
use Statsig\Adapters\LocalFileDataAdapter;
use Statsig\Adapters\LocalFileLoggingAdapter;

$config_adapter = new LocalFileDataAdapter();
$logging_adapter = new LocalFileLoggingAdapter();
$options = new StatsigOptions($config_adapter, $logging_adapter);
$this->statsig = new StatsigServer("server-sdk-key", $options);
```

### ðŸ”¥ Warning - You need to schedule a cron job ðŸ”¥

:::caution
If you do not configure a cron job, your request performance may be impacted.
A check for configuration freshness is made before evaluation (checkGate/getConfig/getExperiment).
If your configurations are over 1 minute old, a network request will be fired to Statsig to update them.
