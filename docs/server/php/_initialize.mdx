There is also a parameter `options` that requires you to pass in a storage adapter for storing configurations and event logs. In this below example, we use a local file storage adapter, but you can write your own to plug in Redis or another storage solution. Create an adapter that implements `Statsig\Adapters\IConfigAdapter` if you do not want to use the local file storage adapter.

:::caution
#### v3.0+
You must setup ConfigAdapter and ensure configs are ready before initialize SDK. SDK does not make any network request call to download configs (and IDLists) anymore. 
Configs fetching should be handled by chron jobs and pre-initialization
:::

```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php'; // path to installation folder

use Statsig\StatsigServer;
use Statsig\StatsigOptions;
use Statsig\Adapters\LocalFileDataAdapter;
use Statsig\Adapters\LocalFileLoggingAdapter;

$config_adapter = new LocalFileDataAdapter();
$logging_adapter = new LocalFileLoggingAdapter();
$options = new StatsigOptions($config_adapter, $logging_adapter);
$this->statsig = new StatsigServer("server-sdk-key", $options);
```

### ðŸ”¥ Warning - You need to schedule a cron job ðŸ”¥

:::caution
#### V3.0+
If you do not configure a cron job, SDK does not fire a network request to fetch the latest config value anymore, instead, config values fetched earlier will be used.
#### < V3.0
If you do not configure a cron job, your request performance may be impacted.
A check for configuration freshness is made before evaluation (checkGate/getConfig/getExperiment).
If your configurations are over 1 minute old, a network request will be fired to Statsig to update them.
