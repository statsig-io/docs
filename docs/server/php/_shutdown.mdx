## Shutting Statsig Down

Because we batch and periodically flush events, some events may still be in memory when your app/server shuts down.

To make sure all logged events are properly flushed, you should tell Statsig to `flush` when your app/server is closing:

```jsx
$this->statsig->flush();
```
