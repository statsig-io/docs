You can install the PHP SDK using composer.

```shell
composer require statsig/statsigsdk
```

The SDK is also [open source and hosted on github](https://github.com/statsig-io/php-sdk). The package is published to [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/statsig/statsigsdk).

To successfully use the PHP SDK, you also need to 
1. Provide a storage adapter to store cache config and event logs (defaults to local file adapter)
2. Schedule a Cron job to poll for config changes and flush event logs to Statsig
3. Initialize and use the SDK
