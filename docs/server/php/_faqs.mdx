#### Can I use ID Lists with the PHP SDK?

Yes, since version `2.0.0`, ID Lists are now supported by the PHP SDK. Any SDK version less than v2.0.0 will not work with ID Lists.

#### Do I need the SDK, can I just use the HTTP API?

import Gist from "react-gist";

If you want a simple snippet for using the http api in php, you may find the [following gist](https://gist.github.com/tore-statsig/c27fb9de65c7a1d1591d161570ae807a) useful. It exposes functions to `checkGate`, `getConfig`, `getExperiment`, and `logEvent`.

Note that the `user` parameter to each of these functions follows the [Statsig User](/server/concepts/user) definition for Server SDKs.
