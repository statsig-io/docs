:::note
This SDK is in Beta, and some instructions here may change over time. **This guide follows setup in the [slim framework](https://www.slimframework.com/) as an example**, you may need to adjust given your setup. See a full, working example [here](https://github.com/daniel-statsig/statsig-php-core-slim-example). If you need help or would like guidance specific to another framework, reach out in the Statsig [Slack](https://statsig.com/slack).
:::

### 1. Install and Add as a Dependency
You can install the new PHP Core SDK using composer:

```shell
composer require statsig/statsig-core-php
```

### 2. Add Scripts & Cron Job

Add post-install and post-update scripts in composer.json: 

```json
"post-install-cmd": [
  "cd vendor/statsig/statsig-core-php && php post-install.php"
],
"post-update-cmd": [
  "cd vendor/statsig/statsig-core-php && php post-install.php"
]
```

Next, you'll want to add a script to sync your Statsig configs and flush your events, see example files on Statsig's Github [here](https://github.com/daniel-statsig/statsig-php-core-slim-example/tree/main/bin)

You'll also want to setup cron jobs to run these scripts periodically:

```shell
*/10 * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/example.com/bin/StatsigSyncConfig.php 1>> /dev/null 2>&1
*/1 * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/example.com/bin/StatsigFlushEvents.php 1>> /dev/null 2>&1
```

Also, be sure to run the StatsigSyncConfig.php cron job at least once before proceeding.
