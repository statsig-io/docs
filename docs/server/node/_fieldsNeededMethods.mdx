### Fields Needed Methods (Enterprise Only)

The following methods allow you to retrieve a list of user fields that are used in the targeting rules for gates, configs, experiments, and layers. These are enterprise-only features and require contacting Statsig to enable them for your account.

```typescript
// Get fields needed for a gate
Statsig.getFieldsNeededForGate(gateName: string): Array<string>

// Get fields needed for a dynamic config
Statsig.getFieldsNeededForDynamicConfig(configName: string): Array<string>

// Get fields needed for an experiment
Statsig.getFieldsNeededForExperiment(experimentName: string): Array<string>

// Get fields needed for a layer
Statsig.getFieldsNeededForLayer(layerName: string): Array<string>
```

#### Description

These methods return an array of strings representing the user fields that are referenced in the targeting rules or conditions of the specified feature. This can be useful for understanding which user properties influence a particular feature's behavior.

#### Example

```typescript
// Get fields needed for the "new_homepage" gate
const fieldsNeeded = Statsig.getFieldsNeededForGate("new_homepage");
console.log(fieldsNeeded); 
// Example output: ["country", "email", "custom.subscription_tier"]
```

> Note: These methods are enterprise-only features. Please contact Statsig if you're interested in using them.
