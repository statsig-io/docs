`statsig.initialize()` takes an optional parameter `options` in addition to the secret key that you can provide to customize the Statsig client. Here are the current options and we are always adding more to the list:

- **api**: string, default `https://statsigapi.net/v1`
  - The base url to use for all network requests.  Defaults to the statsig API.
- **environment**: StatsigEnvironment, default null

  - An object you can use to set environment variables that apply to all of your users in the same session and will be used for targeting purposes.
  - The most common usage is to set the environment tier ('production', 'staging' or 'development'), e.g. `{ tier: 'staging' }`, and have feature gates pass/fail for specific environments.

- **bootstrapValues**: string, default null
  - a string that represents all rules for all feature gates, dynamic configs and experiments. It can be provided to bootstrap the Statsig server SDK at initialization in case your server runs into network issue or Statsig server is down temporarily.
- **rulesUpdatedCallback**: function, default null
  - a callback function that's called whenever we have an update for the rules; it's called with a JSON string (used as is for `bootstrapValues` mentioned above) and a timestamp, like below:

    ```
    options.rulesUpdatedCallback(specsString, timeStamp)
    ```
- **localMode**: boolean, default false
  - disables all network access, so the SDK will only return default (or overridden) values.  Useful in testing
- **initTimeoutMs**: number, default 0
  - sets a maximum time to wait for the config download network request to resolve before considering the SDK initialized and resolving the call to `initialize()`
