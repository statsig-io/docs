#### How can I use the node SDK for server side rendering? {#ssr}

The Node server SDK, starting in `v4.13.0+` supports generating the `initializeValues` needed to bootstrap a `statsig-js` or `statsig-react` SDK and render it on the server/use the SDK without a round trip to Statsig servers.

```
const values = statsig.getClientInitializeResponse(user); // Record<string, unknown> | null
if (values != null) {
  // boostrap your client SDK
  return <StatsigSynchronousProvider initializeValues={values} ... />;
}
```

NOTE: This will not use the `stableID` for gate evaluation as statsig servers would, since there is no request from the client SDK specifying this generated ID.  If you want to use this in conjuction with logged out experimentation, we recommend you use your own identifier, and set it in the `customIDs` field in the `StatsigUser` object.  See [experimenting on custom IDs](/guides/experiment-on-custom-id-types) for more information.

#### How can I mock Statsig for testing?

The Node server SDK, starting in version 4.8.0+, supports a few features to make testing easier.

First, there is a new `StatsigOption` paramter called `localMode`.  Setting `localMode` to true will cause the SDK to never hit the network, and only return default values.  This is perfect for dummy environments or test environments that should not access the network.

Next, there are the `overrideGate` and `overrideConfig` APIs on the global `statsig` instance:

```
function overrideGate(
    gateName: string,
    value: boolean,
    userID?: string,
): void;
```

```
function overrideConfig(
    gateName: string,
    value: object,
    userID?: string,
): void
```

These can be used to set a gate or config override for a specific user, or for all users (by not providing a specific user ID).  Experiments/Autotune are overridden with the `overrideConfig` API.

We suggest you enable `localMode` and then override gates/configs/experiments to specific values to test the various code flows you are building.
