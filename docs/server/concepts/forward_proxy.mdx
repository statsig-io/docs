## Statsig Forward Proxy 
// TODO(eric) to fill

### Use Case
[TODO]
1. Reduced dependency on Statsig Infrastructure Availability
2. Improved performance through localization of download_config_spec to your cluster
3. Support "push" config changes model

### How Forward Proxy works

## Integration with SDK 
// TODO(xin): to fill
:::info
NOTE:  

`Java/Kotlin`, `Python`, and `NodeJS` SDKs have beta versions which support a full integration with Statsig Forward Proxy including GRPC Mode integration with Statsig Forward Proxy.
For other server sdks, there is no support on full integration yet, you can override download_config_spec api in StatsigOptions in order to integrate. You should use carefully and consult us. 
:::
You can now configure SDK network using different network protocol to integrate with Forward Proxy for different endpoints. 
There are 3 network endpoints, download_config_specs,
#### Example usage
```typescript
Statsig.initialize(server_key, )
```

```typescript
```
For information on your specific SDK language, see the language specific docs in the left hand column.
