Statsig SDKs provide two main ways of monitoring the SDK's behavior and performance:
1. **Logs**: The SDK logs important events and errors to help you understand what's happening in your application.
2. **Metrics**: The SDK emits metrics to help you understand the performance of the SDK and the impact of the SDK on your application.

**Supported SDKs**: Most SDKs have some levels of logging, but for more robust and structured logging and metrics, it is currently only supported by the Python SDK.

## Logging Levels and Expected Information
The Statsig SDK uses multiple logging levels to communicate various types of information. Here’s what each logging level represents and what kind of details you can expect at each level:

- Debug: Detailed logs useful for new users onboarding with the SDK and for diagnosing potential issues, such as:
    - Messages when a feature gate does not exist
    - Tracking process flows within the SDK
- Info: General information about the SDK’s operation, typically relevant to regular usage, such as:
    - Messages regarding SDK initialization, including source and version information
    - Notifications when the configuration store is populated
- Warning: Logs about unusual events that may impact functionality but are automatically managed and recovered, such as:
    - Messages indicating fallback behavior was triggered
    - Notifications about reconnection attempts to gRPC services
- Error: Critical logs about issues that severely impact the SDK’s functionality, such as:
    - Messages about initialization failures or timeouts
    - Notifications indicating gRPC fallback, suggesting gRPC is unavailable or incorrect configuration

## SDK Metrics
Some Statsig SDK provides built-in metrics to help you monitor its performance and impact on your application. The specific implementation may vary by programming language, refer to the documentation for the language-specific SDK interface.

### Metric Interface Methods

The following interface methods are provided by the Statsig SDK to track various metrics:

- **Initialization (`init`)**: This method allows users to initialize their observability client (such as StatsD, OpenTelemetry, etc.), preparing the SDK to send metrics and logs to the chosen observability tool.
- **Shutdown (`shutdown`)**: This method is used to gracefully shut down the observability client when sdk is shutting down, ensuring that any pending metrics or logs are properly handled and sent before the SDK is terminated.
- **Counter**: A method that counts occurrences of specific events, providing insight into event frequency.
- **Gauge**: A method used to record point-in-time values, such as the number of active connections or other metrics that don’t accumulate over time.
- **Distribution**: A method that tracks distributions of numerical data over time, such as latency or response times, providing insights into variation and performance.
- **Should Enable High Cardinality Tags**: This method allows users to define if certain high cardinality tags (which can generate large data volumes) should be enabled for detailed tracking. By default, these tags are disabled to control data load but can be selectively enabled as needed.

### List of Metrics

Below is a list of the primary metrics currently available in the SDK:


| **Metric Name**               | **Type**       | **Tags**                                          | **Description**                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `initialization`              | distribution   | `success`, `init_source`, `init_source_api`, `store_populated` | Tracks SDK initialization duration, including whether initialization was successful and if the configuration store was populated. |
| `config_propagation_diff`     | distribution   | `source`, `source_api`, `lcut*`, `prev_lcut*`     | Measures the time difference in configuration propagation, providing insight into potential delays in updating configurations from different sources. |
| `config_no_update`            | counter        | `source`, `source_api`                            | Tracks occurrences where no configuration updates were received, along with metadata on the source and version timestamps. |

> **Note**: Tags marked with `*` (such as `lcut` and `prev_lcut`) are high cardinality tags. By default, these tags are disabled to reduce data volume but can be enabled as needed for detailed tracking.
