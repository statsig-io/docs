:::info
Our SDKs are designed to be invoked in your code at the point where you're serving the experiment treatment or feature. 
For this reason, we recommend leveraging the standard approach of calling `getExperiment`, `checkGate`, or `getLayer` supplying the user object and the key as needed to determine what to serve. 
:::

Often times, customers have the desire to capture all assignments (experiment, gates) in a single call on the server for a each user at the start of their session.
This practice is commonly done as a means to pass assignment information to the client-side a single time, in order to inform the client app of the test groups and features it should apply.

For this use-case, we recommend using the [Client Bootstrapping](/client/concepts/bootstrapping) approach via the `getClientInitializeResponse` server sdk call to generate the full assignments payload (note that the experiment and feature keys within are hashed for privacy) that gets passed down to the client SDK.
