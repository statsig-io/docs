```py
from statsig.statsig_user import StatsigUser
from statsig.statsig_event import StatsigEvent

statsig.log_event(StatsigEvent(StatsigUser("user-id"), "event-name"))
```
Python supports `retry_queue_size`, which allows you to adjust the memory allocated for handling retries. 
While service outages are rare, increasing the retry_queue_size can help minimize event loss by providing additional memory to buffer events during such occurrences. 
This option is generally not needed for typical use but offers added flexibility in exceptional situations.
