import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

Install the sdk using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/statsig/):

```
pip install statsig
```

NOTE: Versions of the SDK before v0.3.0 were a lightweight wrapper around a c shared library built from our Go sdk, and required go to be installed.  Please upgrade to the native python SDK (v0.3.0+)
