#### Where's all the code?

The python sdk is implemented as a lightweight wrapper around a shared library (statsig/shared/statsig.so).
This library is compiled from the [statsig go sdk](https://github.com/statsig-io/go-sdk).
We will evaluate building a pure python SDK based on how this performs along with usage of the SDK itself.
Happy coding!
