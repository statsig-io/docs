`statsig.initialize()` takes an optional parameter `options` in addition to the secret key that you can provide to customize the Statsig client. Create a `StatsigOptions` class to pass in with the following available parameters:

(unit of measure for time related options is seconds)

- **tier**: `StatsigEnvironmentTier | str`, default `None`

  - Sets the environment tier (for gates to evaluate differently in development and production)
  - You can set an environment tier with the `StatsigEnvironmentTier` enum or just as a `str`

- **timeout**: `timeout: int = None`
  - Enforces a minimum timeout on network requests from the SDK
- **init_timeout**: `init_timeout: int = None`
  - Sets the maximum timeout on download config specs and id lists network requests for initialization
- **rulesets_sync_interval**: `rulesets_sync_interval: int = 10`
  - How often the SDK updates rulesets from Statsig servers
- **idlists_sync_interval**: `idlists_sync_interval: int = 60`
  - How often the SDK updates idlists from Statsig servers
- **local_mode**: `local_mode: bool=False`
  - Disables all network requests. SDK returns default values and will not log events. Useful in combination with overrides to mock behavior for tests
- **bootstrap_values**: `bootstrap_values: str = null`
  - a string that represents all rules for all feature gates, dynamic configs and experiments. It can be provided to bootstrap the Statsig server SDK at initialization in case your server runs into network issue or Statsig server is down temporarily.
- **rules_updated_callback**: `rules_updated_callback: typing.Callable = None,`
  - a callback function that's called whenever we have an update for the rules; it's called with a logical timestamp and a JSON string (used as is for bootstrapValues mentioned above). Note that as of v0.6.0, this will be called from a background thread that the SDK uses to update config values.
- **event_queue_size**: `event_queue_size: int = 500`
  - The number of events to batch before flushing the queue to the network. Default 500.
  - Note that events are also batched every minute by a background thread
- **data_store**: `data_store: IDataStore = None`
  - A data store with custom storage behavior for config specs. Can be used to bootstrap Statsig server (takes priority over `bootstrap_values`).
- **proxy_configs*: `*proxy_configs: Optional[Dict[NetworkEndpoint, ProxyConfig]] = None`,
  - Configuration network for each endpoint, for example, download_config_spec, get_id_lists
- **fallback_to_statsig_api**: fallback_to_statsig_api: Optional[bool] = False,
  - Fallback to Statsig CDN for download config specs and get id lists if the overridden api failed.  
- **initialize_sources**: initialize_sources: Optional[List[DataSource]] = None,
  - List of sources SDK tries to get download_config_specs from when initialize. The list is ordered, SDK tries to get source from first element, and stops when getting dcs successfully
- **config_sync_sources**: config_sync_sources: Optional[List[DataSource]] = None,
  - List of sources SDK tries to get download_config_specs from when downloading. The list is ordered, SDK tries to get source from first element, and stops when getting dcs successfully

Example:

```python
from statsig import statsig, StatsigEnvironmentTier, StatsigOptions

options = StatsigOptions(None, StatsigEnvironmentTier.development)
statsig.initialize("secret-key", options)
```

You can also use the `set_environment_parameter` function, but that takes in string values only:

```python
from statsig import statsig, StatsigEnvironmentTier, StatsigOptions

options = StatsigOptions()
options.set_environment_parameter("tier", StatsigEnvironmentTier.development.value)
statsig.initialize("secret-key", options)
```
