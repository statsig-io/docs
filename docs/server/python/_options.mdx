`statsig.initialize()` takes an optional parameter `options` in addition to the secret key that you can provide to customize the Statsig client. Here are the current options and we are always adding more to the list:

- **tier**: `StatsigEnvironmentTier | str`, default `None`

  - Sets the environment tier (for gates to evaluate differently in development and production)
  - You can set an environment tier with the `StatsigEnvironmentTier` enum or just as a `str`
