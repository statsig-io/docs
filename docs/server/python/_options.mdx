`statsig.initialize()` takes an optional parameter `options` in addition to the secret key that you can provide to customize the Statsig client. Here are the current options and we are always adding more to the list:

- **environment**: dict, default `None`

  - An object you can use to set environment variables that apply to all of your users in the same session and will be used for targeting purposes.
  - The primary usage is to set the environment tier, for gates to evaluate differently in development and production
  - You can set an environment tier with the `StatsigEnvironmentTier` enum or just as a `str`
  - There is a helper method for this in `StatsigOptions`:

```python
options = StatsigOptions()
options.set_tier(StatsigEnvironmentTier.development)
```
