## Data Store

If you would like to implement your own caching logic,
or have finer control over the network requests sent to Statsig,
you can implement your own DataStore.
You can provide a DataStore via [StatsigOptions.DataStore](#statsig-options).

If you would like to know more about how Data Stores work, you can read more about the concept [here](/server/concepts/data_store).

### Data Store Interface

You can write you own custom Data Stores that implement the following interface:

<>{props.interface}</>

### Example Implementation

<>{props.example}</>
