## Getting Started

<div>
  The following will outline how to get up and running with Statsig for{" "}
  {props.sdkType}.
</div>

<Gap />

### Create an Account

To work with the SDK, you will need a Statsig account. If you don't yet have an account, you can sign up for a free one [here](https://console.statsig.com/sign_up). You could skip this for now, but you will need an SDK key and some gates/experiments to use with the SDK in just a minute.

### Installation

<div>{props.install}</div>

<Gap />

### Initialize the SDK

After installation, you will need to initialize the SDK using a [Server Secret Key from the statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).

:::info
Do NOT embed your Server Secret Key in client-side applications, or expose it in any external-facing documents. However, if you accidentally expose it, you can create a new one in the Statsig console.

      There is also an optional parameter named <code>options</code> that allows
      you to pass in a <a href="#statsig-options">StatsigOptions</a> to
      customize the SDK.

      <code>initialize</code> will perform a network request. After{" "}
      <code>initialize</code> completes, virtually all SDK operations will be
      synchronous (See{" "}

      ). The SDK will fetch updates from Statsig in the background, independently
      of your API calls.
