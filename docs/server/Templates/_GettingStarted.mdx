### Create an Account

To work with the SDK, you will need a Statsig account. If you don't yet have an account, go ahead and [sign up](https://console.statsig.com/sign_up) for a free account now. You could skip this for now, but you will need an SDK key and some gates/experiments to use with the SDK in just a minute.

### Installation

### Initialize the SDK

After installation, you will need to initialize the SDK using a [Server Secret Key from the statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).

:::info
Do NOT embed your Server Secret Key in client side applications, or expose it in any external facing documents. However, if you accidentally exposed it, you can create a new one in Statsig console.
:::

There is also an optional parameter `options` that allows you to pass in a [StatsigOptions](#statsig-options) to customize the SDK.

<div>{props.initialize}</div>

`initialize` will perform a network request. After `initialize` completes, virtually all SDK operations will be synchronous[^1]--the SDK will fetch updates from Statsig in the background, independently of your API calls.
