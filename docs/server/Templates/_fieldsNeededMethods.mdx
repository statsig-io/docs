### Fields Needed Methods (Enterprise Only)

These methods allow you to retrieve a list of user fields that are used in the targeting rules for gates, configs, experiments, and layers. These are enterprise-only features and require contacting Statsig to enable them for your account.

#### Description

These methods return an array of strings representing the user fields that are referenced in the targeting rules or conditions of the specified feature. This can be useful for understanding which user properties influence a particular feature's behavior.

#### Field Mapping

The fields returned by these methods correspond to the following user properties:

```typescript
// Field mapping between user properties and internal field names
const fieldMapping = {
  userID: 'u',
  email: 'e',
  ip: 'i',
  userAgent: 'ua',
  country: 'c',
  locale: 'l',
  appVersion: 'a',
  time: 't',
  stableID: 's',
  environment: 'en',
  targetApp: 'ta',
};

// Custom fields are prefixed with "cf:"
// Example: fields.add('cf:' + field);
```

> Note: These methods are enterprise-only features. Please contact Statsig if you're interested in using them.
