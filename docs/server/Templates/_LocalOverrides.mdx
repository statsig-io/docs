## Local Overrides <VersionBadge version={props.addedInVersion} /> {#local-overrides}

If you want to locally override gates/configs/experiments/layers, there are a set of override APIs as follows. Coupling this with [StatsigOptions.localMode](#statsig-options) can be useful when writing unit tests.

<>{props.snippet}</>

:::note

1. These only apply locally - they do not update definitions in the Statsig console or elsewhere.
2. The local override API is not designed to be a full mock. They are only a convenient way to override the value of the gate/config/etc.
