## Shutting Statsig Down

Because we batch and periodically flush events, some events may not have been sent when your app/server shuts down.

To make sure all logged events are properly flushed, you should tell Statsig to shutdown when your app/server is closing:

<div>{props.shutdown}</div>

<>
  {props.flush && (
    <div style={{ marginBottom: 15, marginTop: 30 }}>
      Alternatively, if you are operating in a serverless environment/cloud
      function, you may wish to leave Statsig running in case your function is
      recycled but flush the logs to Statsig servers. Or, if you need an async
      method to wait for logs to post before resolving, you can use:
    </div>
  )}
</>

<div>{props.flush}</div>
