## Client SDK Bootstrapping | SSR <VersionBadge version={props.addedInVersion}/> {#bootstrap}

<div style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}>
  The {props.sdkName} server SDK, starting in{" "}
  <code>{props.addedInVersion}</code> supports generating the{" "}
  <code>initializeValues</code> needed to bootstrap a Statsig Client SDK
  preventing a round trip to Statsig servers. This can also be used with web [
  <code>statsig-js</code>, <code> statsig-react</code>] SDKs to perform server
  side rendering (SSR).

### Working with IP or UserAgent Values

This will not automatically use the `ip`, or `userAgent` for gate evaluation as
Statsig servers would, since there is no request from the client SDK specifying these values.
If you want to use conditions like IP, or conditions which are inferred from the IP/UA like:
Browser Name or Version, OS Name or Version, Country, you must manually set the `ip` and `userAgent`
field on the user object when calling <props.signature />.

### Working with StableID

There is no auto-generated `stableID` for device based experimentation,
since the server generates the initialize response without any information from the client SDK.
If you wish to run a device based experiment while using the server to generate the initialize response,
we recommend you:

1. Create a customID in the Statsig console.
   See [experimenting on custom IDs](/guides/experiment-on-custom-id-types) for more information.
2. Generate an ID on the server, and set it in a cookie to be used on the client side as well.
3. Set that ID as the customID on the `StatsigUser` object when generating the initialize response from the SDK.
4. Get that ID from the cookie, and set it as the customID on the `StatsigUser` object when using the client SDK,
   so all event data and exposure checks tie back to the same user.

Alternatively, if you wish to use the `stableID` field rather than a custom ID, you still need to do step (2) above. Then:

- Override the `stableID` in the client SDK by getting the value from the cookie and setting the `overrideStableID`
  parameter in `StatsigOptions`
- Set the `stableID` field on the `StatsigUser` object in the `customIDs` map when generating the initialize response from the SDK
