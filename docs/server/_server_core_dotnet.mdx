## Motivation & Background

.NET Core is a new server SDK leveraging [Statsig's Server Core](https://github.com/statsig-io/private-statsig-server-core), a performance-focused evaluation & logging library written in Rust. Early benchmarking suggests Server Core can evaluate Gates and Experiments in a small fraction of the time native SDKs are capable of.

The .NET Core SDK uses FFI (Foreign Function Interface) bindings to communicate with the high-performance Rust evaluation engine, providing sub-millisecond feature flag evaluation while maintaining the familiar .NET development experience.

We plan to offer Server Core across multiple languages in the near future. Want another language sooner? Reach out in our [Slack Channel](https://statsig.com/slack).
