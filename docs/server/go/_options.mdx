import { LocalModeSnippet } from "../../sdks/_LocalModeSnippet.mdx";

You can specify optional parameters with `options` when initializing using `InitializeWithOptions()`

```go
type Options struct {
	API                string      `json:"api"`
	Environment        Environment `json:"environment"`
	LocalMode          bool        `json:"localMode"`
	ConfigSyncInterval time.Duration
	IDListSyncInterval time.Duration
  BootstrapValues      string
	RulesUpdatedCallback func(rules string, time int64)
}
```

- **Environment**: default nil
  - An object you can use to set environment variables that apply to all of your users in the same session and will be used for targeting purposes.
  - The most common usage is to set the environment tier (string), and have feature gates pass/fail for specific environments. The accepted values are "production", "staging" and "development".
- **LocalMode**: default false
  - <LocalModeSnippet type="server" />
- **ConfigSyncInterval**: default 10 seconds
  - The interval to poll for gate/experiment/config changes.
- **IDListSyncInterval**: default 1 minute
  - The interval to poll for ID list changes.
- **BootstrapValues**: default nil
  - A string that represents all rules for all feature gates, dynamic configs and experiments. It can be provided to bootstrap the Statsig server SDK at initialization in case your server runs into network issue or Statsig server is down temporarily.
- **RulesUpdatedCallback**: default nil
  - The callback that gets invoked whenever the rulesets are updated. It's called with a JSON string that represents the rulesets, and a timestamp for when the rules were updated.
- **UserPersistentStorage**: IUserPersistentStorage default nil
  - A persistent storage adapter for running sticky experiments.

## Client Initialize Response Options

When using `getClientInitializeResponse()`, you can specify additional options through the `GCIROptions` struct:

```go
type GCIROptions struct {
	IncludeLocalOverrides bool
	ClientKey             string
	TargetAppID           string
	HashAlgorithm         string
	IncludeConfigType     bool
	ConfigTypesToInclude  []ConfigType
}
```

- **TargetAppID**: default empty string
  - Specifies a target application ID to filter configurations (feature gates, dynamic configs, experiments, and layers).
  - When specified, the SDK will only return configurations that are targeted to this application ID.
  - This is useful in multi-tenant or multi-application environments where you want to ensure that only configurations relevant to a specific application are evaluated and returned.
  - If not specified, the SDK will attempt to determine the target app ID from the provided client key.
