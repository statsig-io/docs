You can specify optional parameters with `options` when initializing using `InitializeWithOptions()`

```
type Options struct {
	API                string      `json:"api"`
	Environment        Environment `json:"environment"`
	LocalMode          bool        `json:"localMode"`
	ConfigSyncInterval time.Duration
	IDListSyncInterval time.Duration
}
```

- **Environment**: default nil
  - An object you can use to set environment variables that apply to all of your users in the same session and will be used for targeting purposes.
  - The most common usage is to set the environment tier (string), and have feature gates pass/fail for specific environments. The accepted values are "production", "staging" and "development".

- **LocalMode**: default false
  - Disables all network requests from the SDK, so it will only return default values.  Useful in tests/non production environments.
- **ConfigSyncInterval**: default 10 seconds
  - The interval to poll for gate/experiment/config changes.
- **IDListSyncInterval**: default 1 minute
  - The interval to poll for ID list changes.
