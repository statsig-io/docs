## Motivation & Background

PHP-Core is a **brand new from-the-ground-up** server SDK leveraging [Statsig's Server Core](https://github.com/statsig-io/statsig-server-core), a performance-focused evaluation & logging library written in Rust. Early benchmarking suggests Server Core can evaluate Gates and Experiments in a small fraction of the time native SDKs are capable of. 

We plan to offer Server Core across multiple languages in the near future. Want another language sooner? Reach out in our [Slack Channel](https://statsig.com/slack).
