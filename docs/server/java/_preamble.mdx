:::info Server vs. Client
These docs are for using our Java/Kotlin SDK in a multi-user, server side context. For client side android applications, check out our [Android SDK](/client/androidClientSDK) or one of the other client SDKs for your client side applications.
:::

This SDK is written in Kotlin, but exposes methods and overrides to Java based applications.
