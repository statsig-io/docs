#### How can I mock Statsig for testing?

First, there is a `StatsigOption` parameter called `localMode`.
Setting `localMode` to true will cause the SDK to never hit the network,
and only return default values. This is perfect for dummy environments or
test environments that should not access the network.

Next, there are the `overrideGate` and `overrideConfig` APIs on the global `Statsig` interface, see [Local Overrides](#local-overrides).

These can be used to set a gate or config value to be be returned for the given name.

We suggest you enable `localMode` and then override gates/configs to specific values to test the various code flows you are building.

You can view [LocalOverridesTest](https://github.com/statsig-io/java-server-sdk/blob/main/src/test/java/com/statsig/sdk/LocalOverridesTest.kt) to see overrides being used in test.
