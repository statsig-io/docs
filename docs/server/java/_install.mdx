`v1.X.X+` of the SDK is now published only to Maven Central.

To install the SDK, set the Maven Central repository in your `build.gradle`. You probably already have this for other dependencies.

```swift
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```

Then add the dependency:

```swift
implementation 'com.statsig:serversdk:1.X.X' // replace with the most up to date version
```

You can find the versions in the github releases of the [open source sdk repository](https://github.com/statsig-io/java-server-sdk/releases), or from the [maven central repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.statsig/serversdk).

#### Jitpack Deprecation

`v0.X.X` versions of the SDK are available from jitpack, but newer versions will not be published to jitpack.

**NOTE:** If you update Statsig to be pulled from Maven Central instead of jitpack, you can remove `maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }` if Statsig was the only library you got from jitpack and you previously relied on v0.X.X of the SDK.
