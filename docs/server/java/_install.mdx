v1.X.X+ of the SDK is now published only to mavenCentral

To install the SDK, set the maven central repository

```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```

and add the dependency:

```
implementation 'com.statsig:serversdk:serversdk:1.X.X'
```

NOTE: you can remove `maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }` if statsig was the only library you got from jitpack and you previously relied on v0.X.X of the sdk.


v0.X.X versions of the SDK are available from jitpack. You can install the SDK using JitPack. See the latest version and installation steps at https://jitpack.io/#statsig-io/java-server-sdk
