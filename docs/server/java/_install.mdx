v1.X.X+ of the SDK is now published only to mavenCentral

To install the SDK, set the maven central repository in your `build.gradle`.  You probably already have this for other dependencies

```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```

Then add the dependency:

```
implementation 'com.statsig:serversdk:serversdk:1.X.X' // replace with the most up to date version
```

You can find the versions in the github releases of the [open source sdk repository](https://github.com/statsig-io/java-server-sdk/releases), or from the [maven central repository](https://central.sonatype.dev/artifact/com.statsig/serversdk/0.19.3/versions).

NOTE: you can remove `maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }` if statsig was the only library you got from jitpack and you previously relied on v0.X.X of the sdk.


v0.X.X versions of the SDK are available from jitpack. You can install the SDK using JitPack. See the latest version and installation steps at https://jitpack.io/#statsig-io/java-server-sdk
