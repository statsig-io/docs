## Async Evaluation Functions

#### Reason
Server SDKs were originally desgined for maximum backwards compatibility. 
This meant that if a Server SDK did not contain support for an operator or configuration, 
it would fallback to hitting Statsig's servers, ensuring a valid result would be returned. 
This is why all top level evaluation related functions were asynchronous.

In practice however, this is seldom required, so we no longer feel the trade off 
for sync vs async functions is worth it and will be removing the asynchronous functions in newer releases.

#### Example

```java
var result = await Statsig.checkGate("my_gate"); // Bad

var result = Statsig.checkGateSync("my_gate"); // Good
```
