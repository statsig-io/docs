import Gist from 'react-gist';

If you are using php or wordpress, we are still working on a native SDK for multi-user/server environments.  We will also work on a wordpress specific plugin.

For now, you may find the [following gist](https://gist.github.com/tore-statsig/c27fb9de65c7a1d1591d161570ae807a) useful, which creates a lightweight wrapper around the httpAPI for php clients. It exposes functions to `checkGate`, `getConfig`, `getExperiment`, and `logEvent`.

Note that the `user` parameter to each of these functions follows the [Statsig User](/server/concepts/user) definition for Server SDKs.
