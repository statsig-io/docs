## The Basics {#the-basics}

Get started in a few quick steps.

1. [Create a free account on statsig.com](#step1)
2. [Install the SDK](#step2)
3. [Initialize the SDK](#step3)
4. [Check Feature Gates, Dynamic Configs, or Experiments](#step4)
5. [Send logs to Statsig](#step5)
6. [Log a custom event](#step6)

<a name="step1"></a>

#### Step 1 - Create a free account on [www.statsig.com](https://console.statsig.com/sign_up) {#step-1---create-a-free-account-on-wwwstatsigcom}

You could skip this for now, but you will need an SDK Key and some Feature Gates or Dynamic Configs to use with the SDK in just a minute.

<a name="step2"></a>

#### Step 2 - Install the SDK {#step-2---install-the-sdk}

You can install the SDK using composer

```shell
composer require statsig/statsigsdk
```

The SDK is also [open source and hosted on github](https://github.com/statsig-io/php-sdk). The package is published to [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/statsig/statsigsdk).

<a name="step3"></a>

#### Step 3 - Initialize the SDK {#step-3---initialize-the-sdk}

After installation, you will need to initialize the SDK using a [Server Secret Key from the statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).

There is also a parameter `options` that requires you to pass in a storage adapter for storing configurations and event logs. In this below example, we use a local file storage adapter, but you can write your own to plug in Redis or another storage solution. Create an adapter that implements `Statsig\Adapters\IConfigAdapter` if you do not want to use the local file storage adapter.

```java
use Statsig\StatsigServer;
use Statsig\StatsigOptions;
use Statsig\Adapters\LocalFileConfigAdapter;
use Statsig\Adapters\LocalFileLoggingAdapter;

$config_adapter = new LocalFileConfigAdapter();
$logging_adapter = new LocalFileLoggingAdapter();
$options = new StatsigOptions($config_adapter, $logging_adapter);
$this->statsig = new StatsigServer("server-sdk-key", $options);
```

<a name="step4"></a>

#### Step 4 - Fetch Feature Gates, Dynamic Configs, or Experiments {#step-4---fetch-values}

:::info NOTE: The php SDK currently does not support Segments that are using ID lists. Please [file an issue on github](https://github.com/statsig-io/php-sdk/issues) if you need this feature, or reach out to us on our slack channel
:::

Now that your SDK is initialized, let's fetch a [**Feature Gate**](/feature-gates). Feature Gates can be used to create logic branches in code that can be rolled out to different users from the Statsig Console. Gates are always **CLOSED** or **OFF** (think `return false;`) by default.

From this point on, all APIs will require you to specify the user (see [Statsig user](#statsig-user)) associated with the request. For example, check a gate for a certain user like this:

```java
use Statsig\StatsigUser;

$user = StatsigUser::withUserID("123");
$user->setEmail("testuser@statsig.com");

$this->statsig->checkGate($user, "<gate_name>");
```

Feature Gates can be very useful for simple on/off switches, with optional but advanced user targeting. However, if you want to be able send a different set of values (strings, numbers, and etc.) to your clients based on specific user attributes, e.g. country, [**Dynamic Configs**](/dynamic-config) can help you with that. The API is very similar to Feature Gates, but you get an entire json object you can configure on the server and you can fetch typed parameters from it. For example:

```java
$this->statsig->getConfig($user, "<config_name>");
```

Then we have [**Experiments**](/experiments-plus), which you can use to run A/B/n experiments and use advanced features like layers (coming soon) to avoid collision and enable quicker iterations with parameter reuse.

```java
$this->statsig->getExperiment($user, "test_config");
```

<a name="step5"></a>

#### Step 5 - Log a custom event {#step-5---log-event}

Now that you have a Feature Gate or an Experiment set up, you may want to track some custom events and see how your new features or different experiment groups affect these events. This is super easy with Statsig - simply call the Log Event API and specify the user and event name to log; you additionally provide some value and/or an object of metadata to be logged together with the event:

```java
use Statsig\StatsigEvent;

$event = new StatsigEvent("purchase");
$event->setUser($user);
$event->setValue("subscription");
$event->setMetadata(array("promotion" => "2022 deals"));
$this->statsig->logEvent($event);
```

At the end of the request, you can flush events to the log file using:

```java
$this->statsig->flush();
```

#### Step 6 (Optional but Recommended) - Sync Gate/Experiment/Config Defintions and Send Logs

To keep your configurations up to date, and send event data to Statsig, you can create two cron jobs.

**Sync**

The first runs `sync.php` to download the latest definition of gates/configs/experiments from Statsig, and save it to a config file locally.
If you do not update this file, your gate/config/experiment values may be stale and will be refetched during a request, which may lead to slower response times.

```sh
# Run once
php sync.php --secret <STATSIG_SECRET_KEY>
```

```sh
# Create a cron job that runs as statsigsync every minute
echo '*/1 * * * * statsigsync php /my/path/to/statsig/sync.php --secret <STATSIG_SECRET_KEY> > /dev/null' | sudo tee /etc/cron.d/statsigsync
sudo service cron reload    # reload the cron daemon
```

Alternatively, you may provide your own custom adapter that implements Statsig\Adapters\IConfigAdapter if you do not want to use the local file storage adapter.

```sh
php send.php --secret <STATSIG_SECRET_KEY> \
    --adapter-class Namespace\For\MyConfigAdapter \
    --adapter-path /path/to/MyConfigAdapter.php \
    --adapter-arg an_argument_for_my_adapter \
    --adapter-arg another_argument
```

By default, send.php will use the Statsig LocalFileLoggingAdapter which writes to /tmp/statsig.logs

**Send**

The second runs `send.php` to send the exposure data and log events to statsig. Without this data, your events will need to be logged during the lifetime of the request, which may lead to slower resposne times.

```sh
# Run once
php send.php --secret <STATSIG_SECRET_KEY>
```

```sh
# Create a cron job that runs as statsigsync every minute
echo '*/1 * * * * statsigdata php /my/path/to/statsig/send.php --secret <STATSIG_SECRET_KEY> > /dev/null' | sudo tee /etc/cron.d/statsigdata
sudo service cron reload    # reload the cron daemon
```

Alternatively, you may provide your own custom adapter that implements Statsig\Adapters\ILoggingConfig if you do not want to use the local file storage adapter.

```sh
php send.php --secret <STATSIG_SECRET_KEY> \
     --adapter-class Namespace\For\MyConfigAdapter \
     --adapter-path /path/to/MyConfigAdapter.php \
     --adapter-arg an_argument_for_my_adapter \
     --adapter-arg another_argument
```

By default, send.php will use the Statsig LocalFileConfigAdapter which writes to /tmp/statsig.configs

:::caution
If you do not configure a cron job, your request performance may be impacted.
A check for configuration freshness is made before evaluation (checkGate/getConfig/getExperiment).
If your configurations are over 1 minute old, a network request will be fired to Statsig to update them.

## Statsig User {#statsig-user}

When calling APIs that require a user, you should pass as much information as possible in order to take advantage of advanced gate and config conditions (like country or OS/browser level checks), and correctly measure impact of your experiments on your metrics/events. The `userID` field is required because it's needed to provide a consistent experience for a given user (click [here](/server/concepts/user#why-is-statsiguser-with-a-userid-required-for-server-sdks) to understand further why it's important to always provide a userID).

Besides `userID`, we also have `customIDs`, `email`, `ip`, `userAgent`, `country`, `locale` and `appVersion` as top-level fields on StatsigUser. In addition, you can pass any key-value pairs in an object/dictionary to the `custom` field and be able to create targeting based on them.

Note: You must provide userID or at least 1 customID or an exception will be thrown.

```php
class StatsigUser
{

    static function withUserID(string $user_id): StatsigUser

    static function withCustomIDs(array $custom_ids): StatsigUser
    function setUserID(?string $user_id): StatsigUser

    function setEmail(?string $email): StatsigUser

    function setIP(?string $ip): StatsigUser

    function setUserAgent(?string $user_agent): StatsigUser

    function setLocale(?string $locale): StatsigUser

    function setCountry(?string $country): StatsigUser

    function setAppVersion(?string $app_version): StatsigUser

    function setCustom(?array $custom): StatsigUser

    function setPrivateAttributes(?array $private): StatsigUser

    function setCustomIDs(?array $custom_ids): StatsigUser
}
```

#### Have sensitive user PII data that should not be logged? {#private-attributes}

No problem, we have a solution for it! On the StatsigUser object we also have a field called `privateAttributes`, which is a simple object/dictionary that you can use to set private user attributes. Any attribute set in `privateAttributes` will only be used for evaluation/targeting, and removed from any logs before they are sent to Statsig server.

For example, if you have feature gates that should only pass for users with emails ending in "@statsig.com", but do not want to log your users' email addresses to Statsig, you can simply add the key-value pair `{ email: "my_user@statsig.com" }` to `privateAttributes` on the user and that's it!

## Statsig Options {#statsig-options}

StatsigOptions is a common configuration parameter across Statsig SDKs. For the PHP sdk, the following are configurable:

- `IConfigAdapter` (required) - A class that implements IConfigAdapter. Statsig provides the LocalFileConfigAdapter, but you can write your own.
- `ILoggingAdapter` - A class that implements ILoggingAdapter. Statsig provides the LocalFileLoggingAdapter, but you can write your own. If no adapter is provided, logs must be sent during the request.

You can also configure:

- The environment (see [using environments](https://docs.statsig.com/guides/using-environments)) via `setEnvironmentTier("production" | "staging" | "development")`
- The event queue size (How many events to track before they are sent to Statsig) via `setEventQueueSize(int $size)`.

```php

class StatsigOptions
{
    function __construct(IConfigAdapter $config_adapter, ?ILoggingAdapter $logging_adapter = null)

    function getConfigAdapter(): IConfigAdapter

    function getLoggingAdapter(): ?ILoggingAdapter

    function setEnvironmentTier(?string $tier)
    /**
     * @throws Exception - Given size cannot be less than 10 or greater than 1000
     */
    function setEventQueueSize(int $size)
}
```

## FAQ {#faq}

#### How do I run experiments for logged out users? {#logged-out-experiments}

You can run experiments for arbitrary unit IDs (sessionID, groupID, etc), rather than at the userID level, if you choose. These custom unit IDs must be predefined in your Statsig project, and then selected in the Experiment creation flow. For more information, see our guide on [experimenting on custom ID types](/guides/experiment-on-custom-id-types)

#### Using the httpAPI instead

import Gist from "react-gist";

If you want a simple snippet for using the http api in php, you may find the [following gist](https://gist.github.com/tore-statsig/c27fb9de65c7a1d1591d161570ae807a) useful. It exposes functions to `checkGate`, `getConfig`, `getExperiment`, and `logEvent`.

Note that the `user` parameter to each of these functions follows the [Statsig User](/server/concepts/user) definition for Server SDKs.
