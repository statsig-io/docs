### Fields Needed Methods (Enterprise Only)

```rust
// Get fields needed for a gate
let fields_needed: Vec<String> = statsig.get_fields_needed_for_gate("gate_name");

// Get fields needed for a dynamic config
let fields_needed: Vec<String> = statsig.get_fields_needed_for_dynamic_config("config_name");

// Get fields needed for an experiment
let fields_needed: Vec<String> = statsig.get_fields_needed_for_experiment("experiment_name");

// Get fields needed for a layer
let fields_needed: Vec<String> = statsig.get_fields_needed_for_layer("layer_name");
```

These methods return a vector of strings representing the user fields that are referenced in the targeting rules or conditions of the specified feature. This can be useful for understanding which user properties influence a particular feature's behavior.

#### Example

```rust
// Get fields needed for the "new_homepage" gate
let fields_needed = statsig.get_fields_needed_for_gate("new_homepage");
println!("{:?}", fields_needed);
// Example output: ["country", "email", "custom.subscription_tier"]
```

> Note: These methods are enterprise-only features. Please contact Statsig if you're interested in using them.
