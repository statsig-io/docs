Statsig server SDKs allow you to run experiments for server-side functionality such as APIs, algorithms, configurations, and infrastructure improvements. The server SDKs evaluate feature gates, dynamic configurations, and experiments locally on your application server.

Hereâ€™s how the typical workflow with Statsig's server SDK looks:

### Overview of Phases
1. **Initialization**: Setting up the SDK with your server SDK key.
2. **Checking an Experiment**: Evaluating experiments and feature gates.
3. **Logging Custom Events**: Tracking custom events to analyze your experiment's impact.

### 1. Initialization

- Call `initialize` with your **server SDK key**. This makes a network request to fetch all the rule sets (experiments, feature gates, and configurations) to the application server.
- **Key action**: The SDK loads all required configurations to enable local evaluation of experiments, gates, and configs.

---

### 2. Checking an Experiment

- Use the `getExperiment` call with a [**StatsigUser**](/server/concepts/user) object (which includes a user identifier). This returns the assigned variant for the user. You can retrieve the parameter values from the `config` object using the `get` method.
  
- For **Layer-based experiments**, use the `getLayer` call with a [**StatsigUser**](/server/concepts/user) to return the assigned layer and retrieve variant parameters.

- Use `checkGate` with a [**StatsigUser**](/server/concepts/user) to return a boolean (_true_ or _false_) based on whether the user passes the configured feature gate rules.

- Call `getConfig` to retrieve dynamic configurations for the user. This fetches values from the returned `config` object.

- **Automatic Exposure Logging**: The SDK flushes exposure data to the Statsig servers every 60 seconds by default. For short-lived processes (like serverless environments), call `shutdown` to force-flush the data when your application exits.

- **Diagnostics**: You can verify exposure events in real-time in the **Exposure Stream** under the **Diagnostics** tab.

#### Updating Experiment Configuration

- The SDK automatically polls Statsig servers every 10 seconds (configurable) to fetch updated rule sets.

:::info Best Practices

**Why is `StatsigUser` with a `userID` required for server SDKs?**

Check out the [UserID Requirements](/messages/serverRequiredUserID) to understand why having a unique `userID` in the [**StatsigUser**](/server/concepts/user) object is critical for server SDK usage.

**Setting Default Values for Parameters**

It's recommended to include a default value when retrieving parameters from a `config` object using the `get` call. This ensures your app gracefully falls back to default behavior if a parameter isn't configured. By default, Statsig returns _false_ for gates that have not yet been set up.

### 3. Logging Custom Events

- Use `logEvent` to record a custom event for analysis. You can pass the **server SDK key**, user identifier, and the custom event details.
- The SDK automatically flushes custom events every 60 seconds.
- **Metrics Lift**: Statsig uses logged events to compute experiment metrics. These are updated daily in the **Metrics Lift** panel of the experiment's **Results** tab.

---

### Testing Exposure Checks in Development or Staging Environments

- You can test exposure checks in non-production environments by setting the environment tier in the `initialize` call. When testing in **development** or **staging**, make sure to toggle _Show non-production logs_ in the **Exposure Stream** under the **Diagnostics** tab.
  
- To target specific team members for testing, use **Manage Overrides** in the Statsig console to force specific variants for selected users.
