Statsig server SDKs enable you to run experiments for any applications improvements driven by server-side functionality including APIs, algorithms, latency, configuration, and infrastructure improvements. Statsig server SDKs evaluate gate, config, and experiment checks locally on your application server.
  
As shown in the diagram below, implementing an experiment using a Statsig server SDK consists of three phases:
1. Initialization
2. Evaluating Experiment Variants
3. Recording Exposure & Custom Events

### 1. Initialization
-	The server SDK `initialize` call takes the server SDK key and makes a network request to Statsig servers; this network call fetches all rule sets to your application server to enable local evaluation in the next phase

### 2. Evaluating Experiment Variants
-	The server SDK `getExperiment` call takes a [**StatsigUser**](/server/concepts/user) object with a user identifier, evaluates the rules for the specified user, and returns the configuration of the variant that the user is assigned to
-	 If your experiment is part of a Layer, the `getLayer` call takes a [**StatsigUser**](/server/concepts/user) object with a user identifier and returns the experiment configuration for the variant that the your end-user is assigned to;  use the returned `config` to `get` the value of the parameters that you need to implement the test variant
 - The `checkGate` calls takes a [**StatsigUser**](/server/concepts/user) object with a user identifier and returns _true_ if the end-user passes the feature gate rules that you've configured on the Statsig console, and _false_ otherwise 
 - The `getConfig` call takes a [**StatsigUser**](/sever/concepts/user) object with a user identifier and returns the dynamic configuration based on the rules that you've configured for your end-users; use the returned `config` to `get` the value of the parameters that you need to implement a dynamically configured app experience

Statsig recommends including a default value when you make the `get` call to fetch a parameter value from the returned `config` object in case the parameter has not been configured in the experiment, layer, or dynamic config that you're implementing. Statsig automatically defaults to _false_ when you check a gate that has not been configured.   

The server SDK polls Statsig servers for updates to the rule sets every 10 seconds. The Statsigâ€™s servers service these requests through a cache with a TTL of 60 seconds. This means that it may take 10 - 70 seconds to propagate any rule updates to the server SDK. 

:::info Why is StatsigUser with a UserID required for server SDKs?

### 3. Recording Exposure & Custom Events

 - The server SDK automatically flushes events to the Statsig servers every 10 seconds; you can also force this flush by calling `shutdown` to flush exposure events and custom events to Statsig servers. You can verify that these exposure events are being recorded in Statsig servers using the live **Exposure Stream** in the Statsig console under the **Diagnostics** tab of your experiment
-	The **Users** and **Checks** charts in the **Diagnostics** tab are updated hourly. Experiment **Results** with the **Metrics Lift** panel is updated daily around 9am PST.
