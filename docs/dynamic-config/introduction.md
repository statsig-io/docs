## What is dynamic config?
Dynamic config is a tool that replaces hard-coded values in your application with configuration parameters defined on the server. These configuration parameters can include any property across your client-side or server-side application code, from button colors to ranking configurations. This enables you to control the behavior of your application dynamically in near real-time.

## When to use dynamic config
Many technology companies use tools such as dynamic config to make their server-side code the source of truth for configurable application properties. For example, Spotify uses [Remote Configuration](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/10/29/spotifys-new-experimentation-platform-part-1/) to dynamically update properties of their clients or backend services. 

To get started, see the Statsig guide to making your code more flexible with your [first dynamic config](https://docs.statsig.com/guides/first-dynamic-config).
