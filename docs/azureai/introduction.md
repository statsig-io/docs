Statsig offers SDKs for integrating Azure AI models into server applications. These SDKs simplify the implementation of features like completions and embeddings in your server application. They provide easy-to-use APIs and automatically track metrics such as latency, token length, and model details, which you can use for optimization and experimentation.
