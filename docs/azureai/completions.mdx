Chat completions are AI-generated responses used to generate text. They could enable generic text completion, or interactive dialogue based on a given prompt or message history. In a completion, the AI model considers the sequence of messages exchanged and provides a response that fits naturally within the conversation flow. 

## Simple completions

<Tabs
  groupId="language-choice"
  defaultValue="nodejs"
  values={[
    {label: 'NodeJS', value: 'nodejs'},
    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},
    {label: '.Net', value: 'dotnet'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="nodejs">
```js
const messages = [
  { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant. You will talk like a pirate." },
  { role: "user", content: "What is the best way to train a parrot?" },
];

const result = await modelClient.complete(messages);
for (const choice of result.choices) {
  console.log(choice.message.content);
}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">
```python
response = modelClient.complete([
    SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant. You will talk like a pirate."),
    UserMessage(content="What is the best way to train a parrot?")
])
self.assertIsNotNone(response, "Expected response to not be None")

for item in response.choices:
    content = item.message.content
    print(content)
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="dotnet">
```csharp
var completion = await modelClient.Complete(
  "You are a helpful assistant that speaks like a pirate",
  "How do you train a parrot in 10 easy steps?"
);

Console.WriteLine(completion);
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Output
```
Arrr, trainin’ a parrot be quite the adventure, savvy? Here be some tips fer ye:

1. **Build Trust**: Spend time with yer feathered matey, talk to ‘im in a gentle voice, and let ‘im get used to yer presence.

2. **Positive Reinforcement**: Reward yer parrot with treats or affection when it learns a trick or obeys a command. Parrots, like all creatures, respond well to praise!

3. **Consistent Commands**: Use the same words or phrases fer commands each time. Repeatin’ yerself helps the parrot make connections.

4. **Short Training Sessions**: Keep yer sessions short and sweet, perhaps 5 to 10 minutes. Parrots have short attention spans, ye see!

5. **Be Patient**: Not every parrot learns at the same pace. Keep yer cool, and don't lose yer temper; patience be key!

6. **Fun and Play**: Incorporate games into yer training to keep it interestin’. A happy parrot be a learnin’ parrot!

Keep these tips in yer captain’s log, and yer parrot’ll be squawkin’ like a true pirate in no time! Arrr!

## Streaming Completions

Sometimes you want to start streaming the AI responses back to your client, to reduce latency and increase responsiveness.  You can accomplish that by using the Streaming API

<Tabs
  groupId="language-choice"
  defaultValue="nodejs"
  values={[
    {label: 'NodeJS', value: 'nodejs'},
    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},
    {label: '.Net', value: 'dotnet'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="nodejs">
```js
const messages = [
  { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant. You will talk like a pirate." },
  { role: "user", content: "What is the best way to train a parrot?" },
];

const stream = await modelClient.streamComplete(messages);
for await (const event of stream) {
  if (event.data === "[DONE]") {
    return;
  }
  for (const choice of JSON.parse(event.data)?.choices) {
    process.stdout.write(choice.delta?.content ?? "");
  }
}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">
```python
response = modelClient.stream_complete([
    SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant. You will talk like a pirate."),
    UserMessage(content="What is the best way to train a parrot?")
])

for update in response:
    print(update.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="", flush=True)
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="dotnet">
```csharp
var completion = await modelClient.StreamComplete(
  "You are a helpful assistant that speaks like a pirate",
  "How do you train a parrot in 10 easy steps?"
);

await foreach (var update in completion) {
  if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(update.ContentUpdate)) {
    Console.Write(update.ContentUpdate);
  }
}
```
