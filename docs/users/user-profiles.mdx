# User Profiles

# Overview

User profiles allow you to streamline event tracking and enhance analysis by storing and leveraging user properties without the need to resend them with every event. For example, you could imagine a social network where each user has a friend count, but it might not make sense to send that friend count on every single event. In this example, you would update the information periodically as part of the user’s profile, and then be able to leverage that in analysis scenarios.

Whenever you call .logEvent() with updated user properties, we’ll automatically update the user profile. New properties are added, and existing ones are updated as needed.

Now, when you’re querying on Metrics Explorer, you’ll be able to take advantage of user profile properties. Because we join your events with the user profile table in the background, queries in Metrics Explorer may take slightly longer to process.
