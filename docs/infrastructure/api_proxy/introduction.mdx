This section provides documentation on the various API proxy options supported when using Statsig.

## Why Use an API Proxy?

There are several compelling reasons to implement an API proxy for Statsig network requests:

1. **Mitigate Tracking Blocker Impact**: Reduce the effect of tracking blockers on Statsig API usage.
2. **Meet Security Requirements**: Comply with internal network security and topology standards.
3. **Enhance API Availability**: Improve API availability guarantees within your internal network boundary.

## API Proxy Deployment Options

API proxies can be deployed in various forms, each with its own advantages and considerations. The choice between a managed service and a self-hosted solution, or deploying outside versus inside your network, depends on your specific needs.

We offer documentation on the following options.

For both server SDKs and client SDKs:

- [Custom Proxy](/custom_proxy): A fully customizable proxy that you own and operate in your environment.
- [Managed Proxy](/infrastructure/managed-proxy): A lightweight, Statsig-owned proxy that provides out-of-the-box functionality.

For server SDKs only:

- [Forward Proxy](/server/concepts/forward_proxy): A Statsig-built proxy designed for deployment within your own environment.

Choose the option that best aligns with your infrastructure requirements and operational preferences. If you have any questions/concerns, drop on in to our [slack channel](https://www.statsig.com/slack) and let us know.
