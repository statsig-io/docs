title: API Proxy
---

This section provides documentation on the various API proxy options supported when using Statsig.

## Why Use an API Proxy?

There are several compelling reasons to implement an API proxy for Statsig network requests:

1. **Mitigate Tracking Blocker Impact**: Reduce the effect of tracking blockers on Statsig API usage.
2. **Meet Security Requirements**: Comply with internal network security and topology standards.
3. **Enhance API Availability**: Improve API availability guarantees within your internal network boundary.

## API Proxy Deployment Options

API proxies can be deployed in various forms, each with its own advantages and considerations. The choice between a managed service and a self-hosted solution, or deploying outside versus inside your network, depends on your specific needs.

We offer documentation on the following options:

- [Custom Proxy](/custom_proxy): A fully customizable proxy that you own and operate in your environment.
- [Managed Proxy](/infrastructure/managed-proxy): A lightweight, Statsig-owned proxy that provides out-of-the-box functionality.
- [Forward Proxy](/server/concepts/forward_proxy): A Statsig-built proxy designed for deployment within your own environment to optimize the reliability of server SDKs.

Choose the option that best aligns with your infrastructure requirements and operational preferences. If you have any questions/concerns, drop on in to our [slack channel](https://www.statsig.com/slack) and let us know.
