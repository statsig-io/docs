# Infrastructure Operations

Statsig's infrastructure is the foundation that enables reliable feature flagging, experimentation, and analytics at enterprise scale. When you're running experiments that impact millions of users or managing feature flags for critical business logic, infrastructure reliability becomes paramount to your product's success.

## Why Infrastructure Matters for Feature Flagging & Experimentation

Feature flagging and experimentation platforms require robust infrastructure to deliver consistent, low-latency responses that don't impact your application's performance. Every feature gate evaluation, experiment assignment, and analytics event must be processed reliably to ensure:

- **Consistent User Experiences**: Users should always receive the same feature variant throughout their session
- **Real-time Decision Making**: Feature flags need to evaluate in milliseconds to avoid blocking your application
- **Accurate Experiment Results**: Every user interaction must be captured and processed to generate reliable statistical insights
- **Business Continuity**: Infrastructure downtime can't block feature releases or compromise running experiments

## Enterprise-Grade Scale & Reliability

Statsig processes massive volumes of data while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability standards:

### Key Metrics
- **1+ Trillion** events processed per day
- **2.5 Billion** unique monthly experiment subjects  
- **99.99%** infrastructure uptime for API & Console
- **&lt;1ms** post-init evaluation latency

### Enterprise Customers
Statsig powers feature flagging and experimentation for industry leaders including OpenAI, Figma, Brex, Notion, Atlassian, Microsoft, Flipkart, and other enterprises operating at massive scale.

### Scalable Architecture
All customers get access to enterprise-grade infrastructure from day one. There's never a reason to switch tools or migrate to an "enterprise-grade" solution as you grow. Statsig scales with you regardless of volume, while offering the most affordable pricing across all products and customer tiers.

## End-to-End Managed Infrastructure

Statsig provides comprehensive infrastructure management including:
- Real-time health checks and monitoring
- Automated guardrails to ensure reliable results
- Multi-region deployment for global availability
- Built-in redundancy and failover capabilities
