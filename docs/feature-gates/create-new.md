When you create a feature gate, it is enabled by default as shown below. This means that any call to check this feature gate for a user evaluates the rules that you define for this feature gate. This check returns a **true** or **false** depending on whether that user matches these rules. If no rules are defined, the gate check returns **false** by default.

You can disable the feature gate by clicking on the toggle button next to the name of the feature gate. Statsig always returns **false** when you check a feature gate thatâ€™s disabled. 

When you need more than a Boolean value returned for different groups of users, say to customize the user experience, set up a [dynamic config](https://docs.statsig.com/dynamic-config).
