## Override results of a feature gate

During development, it can be useful to explicitly state which users should pass or fail a given feature gate. This is where overrides come in.

Overrides are based of user IDs and can be set to pass or fail for a given user ID. During evaluation of a gate, if the user ID is overridden, the overridden result will be returned immediately before any rules are evaluated.

### Adding an Override

- Log into the Statsig console at https://console.statsig.com
- On the left-hand navigation panel, select **Feature Gates**
- Select the feature gate where you want to add an Override
- Click the **Add Override** button

- Select either 'Pass List' or 'Fail List' from the tabs in the dialog

- For users you want to pass the gate, add them to the 'Pass List'
- For users you want to fail the gate, add them to the 'Fail List'

  :::info Note
  A user can only exist on one of these lists at a time.

- Once you have added the user IDs, hit **Save**

### Deleting an Override

If you add an override but later decide it is no longer needed. You can remove it so the rules will be evaluated as normal.

- Log into the Statsig console at https://console.statsig.com
- On the left-hand navigation panel, select **Feature Gates**
- Select the feature gate where you want to add an Override
- Click the **Edit Overrides** button

- Once you have updated the lists, hit **Save**

### Testing an Override

Once your override has been added, you can test it in the "Test Gate" window by simply adding userID as a property of the user object.
