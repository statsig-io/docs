It is important for your codebase and team to bring feature gates to a final state (i.e. flags now permanently part of your codebase or completely removed) when they have served their purpose, as described [here](https://docs.statsig.com/feature-gates/feature-gates-lifecycle). On Statsig, you can use feature gate **Types** to easily keep track of your flags that might be ready to brought to their final state.

## Types
In your feature gates catalog, you'll see different **Types** displayed in the Status column, as well as under the filter option -

- **Permanent Gates** (set by you)
    - **Permanent feature gates** are expected to live in your codebase for an extended period of time, beyond a feature release, usually for operations or infrastructure control. Common examples include user permissions (e.g. premium features based on subscription level) or circuit breakers/kill switches (e.g. terminating a connection to prevent negative customer impact) or even supporting legacy features in old app versions.
        - There are two ways to mark a gate as **Permanent**: 
            - When creating the gate: the **Permanent** box in the gate creation flow

            - After a gate has been created: click on the "..." menu and then "Mark Gate Permanent"

    - Implications of marking a gate as **Permanent**
        - No change in the gate’s behavior when called
        - Easy filtering on feature gates catalog
        - More caution in its management: while you are able to archive or delete a **permanent** feature gate, there will be a warning shown before proceeding
        - Statsig will forgo reminding you to clean up these gates and may display them differently in the console
    - You will be able to change the gate back to **Temporary** at any point.
        - All newly created feature gates are marked as **Temporary**, unless marked otherwise (i.e. Permanent). Therefore, Statsig will not display the phrase **Temporary** in the feature gates Catalog or within the individual gates page.
- **Stale Gates** (set by Statsig)
    - **Stale feature gates** indicate to your team that these gates could be a good candidate for cleanup. Statsig automatically marks gates as stale based on the following definition (excludes Permanent and newly created gates) -
        - 0 checks within last 30 days OR
        - gate rolled out to 100% or 0%
    - Implications of gates being marked as **Stale**
        - No change in the gate’s behavior when called
        - Easy filtering on Feature Gates catalog
        - Will include the gate in Statsig’s nudges for cleanup (more below)

## Nudges to clean up Stale gates

Using the **Stale** type discussed above, Statsig provides both in-console and external nudges to remind you to cleanup (or make Permanent) your feature gates. 
- In-console
    - See the reminder at the top of the individual feature gate page
