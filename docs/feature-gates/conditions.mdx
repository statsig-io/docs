## Introduction

Statsig feature gates contain a list of rules that are evaluated in order from top to bottom. The page describes in more detail how these rules are evaluated and lists all currently supported conditions.

### Rule Evaluation

The rules that you create are evaluated in the order they're listed. For each rule, the **criteria** or **conditions** determine which users _qualify_ for the Pass/Fail treatments. The Pass percentage further determines the percentage of _qualifying_ users that will be exposed to the new feature. The remaining _qualifying_ users will see the feature disabled.

Suppose you set up your rules as shown below, the following flow chart illustrates how Statsig evaluates these rules. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1315028/154173697-e7c648b3-58f2-4b16-ba64-7222d152647e.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1315028/154177120-2f4db628-9899-4435-879c-9b1a4783024e.png)

Note that as soon as a user qualifies based on the condition in a given rule, Statsig doesn't evaluate subsequent rules for this user. Statsig then picks the qualifying user to be in either the Pass or Fail group of that rule.  

Also note that in the example, the third rule for **Remaining Folks** captures all users who don't qualify for previous two rules. If we were to remove this third rule, then only a subset of your users (users in pools 1 and 2) would qualify for this feature gate and for further analysis, not your total user base.

### Client vs Server SDKs
All of the following conditions work on both client and server SDKs.  Client SDKs handle these conditions a bit more automatically for you - if you do not provide a userID, client SDKs rely on an auto-generated "stable identifier" which is persisted to local storage.
In addition, if you do not automatically set an IP or User Agent (UA), the client SDK will infer these attributes from the request IP and UA. Similarly, on mobile, the client SDK will automatically pass your app version and locale to the server so conditions using these attributes can be evaluated without having to set them explicitly.

### Stability
Evaluations at a given percentage are *stable* with respect to the userID.  If userID = 4 passes a condition at a 50% rollout, they will always pass at that 50% rollout. Want to reset that stability? See [Resalting](https://docs.statsig.com/feature-gates/conditions#resalting).

### Resalting
Gate evaluations are stable for a given gate, percentage rollout, and user ID.  This is made possible by the salt associated with a feature gate. If you want to reset a gate, triggering a reshuffle of users, you can "resalt" a gate from the dropdown menu in the top right of the feature gate details page.

![Resalt UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/137390888-3dd5795a-fa33-4e91-ae5b-738ef5e2197d.png)

### Partial Rollouts
While 0% or 100% rollouts for gates are simply "on for users matching this rule"/"off for users matching this rule", each rule allows you to specify a percentage of qualifying users who should pass (see the new feature).
If you want to get [Pulse Results](/pulse) (metric movements caused by a feature), simply specifying a number between 0% and 100% will create a random allocation of users in Pass/Fail or "test"/"control" groups for a simple A/B test.
You can use this to validate that a new feature does not regress existing metrics as you roll it out to everyone.  Statsig suggests a 2% -> 10% -> 50% -> 100% roll out strategy. Each progressive roll out will generate its own Pulse Results as shown below.

## Supported Conditions

### User ID {#userid}
Usage: Simple lists of User IDs to explicitly target or exclude from a gate.

Supported Operators: Any of, none of

Example usage: Add yourself (or a small group like your team) when you just start building a new feature.  Or exclude your designer until it's ready for their eyes.

![Small user id allowlist example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/137389819-d2f20bb5-235b-4d86-b2f4-a73f515909d9.png)

### Email {#email}
Usage: Target based on the email of the user

Supported Operators: any of, none of, contains any of, contains none of

Example: Show new feature to people in the Statsig company with an authenticated @statsig.com email address

![Email condition example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/137401967-333d51a4-d358-4ac5-8055-a50dc108864a.png)

### Everyone {#everyone}
Usage: Percentage rollout on the remainder of users that reach this condition.  Think of it as "everybody else" - there could be a dozen other rules/conditions above it, but for everyone else, what percentage do you want to pass?

Supported Operators: None. Percentage based only.

Example usage: 50/50 rollout to A/B test a new feature.  Or 0% to hide the feature for all people not matching a set of rules. Or 100% to show the feature to the remaining users who did not meet a condition above.

![Everyone 50/50 condition example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/137390172-a73fd908-e23c-489e-8c2e-92f01e3b43a5.png)

### App Version {#app-version}
Usage: User's on a particular version of your app/website will pass.  Particularly useful for mobile app development, where a feature may not be fully ready (or maybe be broken) in a particular app version.

Supported Operators: >=, >, <, <=, any of, none of

Example: Turn off a feature for all users on app versions 3.0.0 through 3.1.0 as it was broken.

![App version Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/137393710-f93b4fda-d7ae-40d8-bd5d-4703d9b136d1.png)

### Browser Version {#browser-version}
Usage: A particular version of a browser, parsed from the user agent.  Should likely be combined with the browser name condition.

Supported Operators: >=, >, <, <=, any of, none of

Example: Turn off a feature for old versions of chrome which don't support a certain API

![Browser Name and Version example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/137394148-cb84ce40-0478-4f1b-a40e-bec5af8c5e08.png)

### Browser Name {#browser}
Usage: A particular browser, parsed from the user agent:
    ('Chrome',
    'Chrome Mobile',
    'Edge',
    'Edge Mobile',
    'IE',
    'IE Mobile',
    'Opera',
    'Opera Mobile',
    'Firefox',
    'Firefox Mobile',
    'Mobile Safari',
    'Safari').
Often combined with the Browser Version condition.

Supported Operators: >=, >, <, <=, any of, none of

Example: Turn off a feature for old versions of chrome which don't support a certain API

To test: The Browser Name is inferred from the `userAgent`, but if you need to set it explicitly, you can set `browserName` in the user object.

![Browser Name and Version example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/137394148-cb84ce40-0478-4f1b-a40e-bec5af8c5e08.png)

### OS Version {#os-version}
Usage: A particular os version the user is on, parsed from the user agent.  Should likely be combined with the Operating System condition.

Supported Operators: >=, >, <, <=, any of, none of

Example: Turn off a feature for versions of macOS which don't support a certain API

![Operating System example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/137398532-bac9b55b-07f1-48b2-a0c9-edcaec55d528.png)

### Operating System {#os}
Usage: A particular operating system, parsed from the user agent:
    ('Android', 'iOS', 'Linux', 'Mac OS X', 'Windows').
Often combined with the OS Version condition.

Supported Operators: any of, none of

Example: Turn off a feature for versions of macOS which don't support a certain API

To test: The OS is inferred from the `userAgent`, but if you need to set it explicitly, you can set `deviceOS` in the user object.

![Operating System example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/137398532-bac9b55b-07f1-48b2-a0c9-edcaec55d528.png)

Supported Operators: development/staging/prod/(other)

Example: Only show a feature on development builds

![Environment tier example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/137402331-c9f9eb46-de8b-49b6-8abc-f480d9334c95.png)

Supported Operators: any of, none of, is null, is not null, contains any of, contains none of, regex

Example: Add yourself (or a small group like your team) when you just start building a new feature.

![Unit id example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26360698/234152123-c77fb946-f74c-4be4-80c7-e5513ecbb90f.png)

### Time

Usage: Evaluate a gate relative to the current time (in PST for client SDKs, or your server time for server SDKs)

Supported Operators: after time, before time, on date

Example: Show the black friday sale banner on black friday

![Time example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/137403991-a2a2fe50-c912-42fc-bc11-6aa1eb5097c2.png)

### Private Attributes
Usage: Any user field conditions, or custom field conditions, can be used via a private attribute.  If you are targeting an email, but don't want it to be logged, 
create an email condition, but put "email": "xyz@email.com" in the privateAttributes dictionary.  For custom fields, create a custom field condition, but put the key/value pair in privateAttributes instead.
Remember that privateAttributes are used for evaluation only, and are not stored or kept on logEvents.

Supported Operators: dependent on the condition

Example: Only show a feature to 20 somethings, as marked by the privateAttributes object having "age": "20-29".

![Private attributes example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/137403635-33b46da3-5508-432e-b3b4-4ed9990edf0f.png)

## FAQs
**1. Could users switch between control (fail) and test (pass) groups?** 
Once a user is exposed, they will be included in the analysis going forward. They saw the new feature and were affected. If the feature gate rules are modified or the user's attributes change in a way that the user no longer qualifies, they will stop receiving the new feature. However, they will continue to be counted for analysis. Once you roll out the feature, all users will see the new feature; alternatively, if you turn off the feature gate, all users will see the control (feature disabled). In either case (roll out or turn off), Statsig performs no further analysis.

**2. How do overrides work? Are users included in overrides also included in the analysis?**
When you add user IDs in the **Pass** or **Fail** lists of your feature gate, these users will see the appropriate treatment but will not be included in the analysis.
