## Introduction

Statsig feature gates contain a list of **rules**, which are evaluated in order from top to bottom.
As soon as a user passes the **condition(s)** in a given rule, subsequent rules will be ignored.
The user is then evaluated against the percentage rollout of that rule, passing if they meet the threshold and failing otherwise.

WARNING - order matters for rules!  If a user meets a condition at the top, evaluation stops (regardless of if they pass or fail the rollout percentage).
Another way to think of it, using boolean logic: rules are combined with an OR (short circtuiting when one is true), while conditions are combined with AND.

If the user passes condition 1 and 2, condition 3 is never evaluated.  The rollout percentage of rule 1 would then be evaluated against the userID and salt of the gate.

This document defines all of the currently supported **conditions**.

### Client vs Server SDKs
All of the following conditions work on both client and server SDKs.  Client SDKs handle a bit more automatically for you - if you do not provide a userID, client SDKs rely on a generated "stable identifier" which is persisted to local storage.
In addition, if you do not automatically set an IP or User Agent, it will infer it from the request IP and UA. Similarly, on mobile, the SDK will automatically pass your app version and locale to the server so those conditions can be evaluated without having to set them explicitly.

### Stability
Evaluations at a given percentage are *stable* with respect to the userID.  If userID = 4 passes a condition at a 50% rollout, they will always pass at that 50% rollout.  Want to reset that stability?  See "resalting"

### Resalting
Gate evaluations are stable for a given gate, percentage rollout, and user ID.  This is made possible by the salt associated with a feature gate. If you want to reset a gate, reshuffling users randomly, you can "resalt" a gate from the dropdown menu in the top right of the feature gate details page.

![Resalt UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/137390888-3dd5795a-fa33-4e91-ae5b-738ef5e2197d.png)

### Partial Rollouts
0% or 100% rollouts for gates are simply "on for users matching this rule"/"off for users matching this rule".  But each rule allows you to specify a percentage of matching users who should pass.
If you want to get [pulse results](/pulse) (metric movements caused by a feautre), simply specifying a number between 0 and 100 will create a random allocation of users in "test"/"control" groups for a simple A/B test.
You can use this to validate a new feature does not regress existing metrics as you roll it out to everyone.  Statsig suggests a 2% -> 10% -> 50% -> 100% Rollout strategy, which will generate a pulse view for each rollout percentage.

## Supported Conditions

### User ID {#userid}
Usage: Simple lists of User IDs to explicitly target or exclude from a gate.

Supported Operators: Any of, none of

Example usage: Add yourself (or a small group like your team) when you just start building a new feature.  Or exclude your designer until its ready for their eyes.

![Small user id allowlist example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/137389819-d2f20bb5-235b-4d86-b2f4-a73f515909d9.png)

### Email {#email}
Usage: Target based on the email of the user

Supported Operators: any of, none of, contains any of, contains none of

Example: Show new feature to people in the Statsig company with an authenticated @statsig.com email address

![Email condition example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/137401967-333d51a4-d358-4ac5-8055-a50dc108864a.png)

### Everyone {#everyone}
Usage: Percentage rollout on the remainder of users that reach this condition.  Think of it as "everybody else" - there could be a dozen other rules/conditions above it, but for everyone else, what percentage do you want to pass?

Supported Operators: None. Percentage based only.

Example usage: 50/50 rollout to A/B test a new feature.  Or 0% to hide the feature for all people not matching a set of rules. Or 100% to show the feature to the remaining users who did not meet a condition above.

![Everyone 50/50 condition example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/137390172-a73fd908-e23c-489e-8c2e-92f01e3b43a5.png)

### App Version {#app-version}
Usage: User's on a particular version of your app/website will pass.  Particularly useful for mobile app development, where a feature may not be fully ready (or maybe be broken) in a particular app version.

Supported Operators: >=, >, <, <=, any of, none of

Example: Turn off a feature for all users on app versions 3.0.0 through 3.1.0 as it was broken.

### Browser Version {#browser-version}
Usage: A particular version of a browser, parsed from the user agent.  Should likely be combined with the browser name condition.

### Private Attributes
Usage: Any user field conditions, or custom field conditions, can be used via a private attribute.  If you are targeting an email, but don't want it to be logged, 
create an email condition, but put "email": "xyz@email.com" in the privateAttributes dictionary.  For custom fields, create a custom field condition, but put the key/value pair in privateAttributes instead.
Remember that privateAttributes are used for evaluation only, and are not stored or kept on logEvents.

Supported Operators: dependent on the condition

Example: Only show a feature to 20 somethings, as marked by the privateAttributes object having "age": "20-29".

![Private attributes example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/137403635-33b46da3-5508-432e-b3b4-4ed9990edf0f.png)
