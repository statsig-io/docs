## View feature gate exposures

To see the number of users who are being exposed to a feature gate, 
- Log into the Statsig console at https://console.statsig.com 
- On the left-hand navigation panel, select **Feature Gates**
- Select the feature gate that you want to test
- Click on the **View Pulse** button at the top right corner of the page
- The **Cumulative Exposures** panel shows total exposures of a feature gate, including a breakdown of users exposed to the feature (treatment or Pass group) and users not exposed to the feature (control or Fail group)

- The **Metrics Lifts** panel shows how your feature is performing based on lifts in your business metrics. In the example below, the rises in *purchase event count* and *purchase event count from daily active users* are statistically significant, suggesting a positive result for the new feature.
