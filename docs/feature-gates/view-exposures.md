- On the left-hand navigation panel, select **Feature Gates**
- Select the feature gate that you want to test

- The **Metrics Lifts** panel shows how your feature is performing based on lifts in your business metrics. In the example below, the rises in *purchase event count* and *purchase event count from daily active users* are statistically significant, suggesting a positive result for the new feature.
