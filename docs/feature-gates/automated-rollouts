## Create a rule for a feature gate

By default, a feature gate check returns **false** when there are no rules configured to target a set of users. You can add a rule to a feature gate to expose the new feature to a targeted set of users as follows: 
- Log into the Statsig console at https://console.statsig.com 
- On the left-hand navigation panel, select **Feature Gates**
- Select the feature gate where you want to add a targeting rule
- Click the **Add New Rule** button

- You can select the criteria for identifying your target users in several ways:
  - You can target users based on common application properties such as the operating system that the application is running on as shown below

  - You can target users based on their attributes; for example, you can select the user's **Email** attribute and the **Contains any of** operator, and enter the email domain of your company to target only internal employees as shown below
