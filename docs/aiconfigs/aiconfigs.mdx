What is an AI Config?
An AI Config is a way to represent an LLM prompt or a task in Statsig. AI Configs are similar to Dynamic Configs, and allow you to evaluate and roll out prompts in production without deploying code. 

With AI Configs, you can 
- Manage your prompt configuration outside of your application code. You can update model, configuration or prompt at runtime. 
- Team mates who have access to Statsig can collaborate and iterate on prompts, while benefitting from Statsig's production change control processes and versioning. 
- Add configuration for a new model, model provider and progressively shift production traffic to this while comparing costs, user satisfaction or any metric of interest. 

AI Configs also allow you evaluate your prompt offline (via Offline Evals) or online (via Experiments).
