## What is an AI Config?
An AI Config is a way to represent an LLM prompt or a task in Statsig. AI Configs are similar to Dynamic Configs, and allow you to evaluate and roll out prompts in production without deploying code. 

With AI Configs, you can 
- Manage your prompt configuration outside of your application code. You can update model, configuration or prompt at runtime. 
- Team mates who have access to Statsig can collaborate and iterate on prompts, while benefitting from Statsig's production change control processes and versioning. 
- Add configuration for a new model, model provider and progressively shift production traffic to this while comparing costs, user satisfaction or any metric of interest. 
- Support advanced use cases such as
   - retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and
   - evaluation in production.

## What are Offline Evals
Offline evals offer a quick, automated grading of model outputs on a fixed test set. They catch wins / regressions early—before any real users are exposed. e.g. compare a new support‑bot’s replies to gold (human curated) answers to decide if it is good enough to ship.
