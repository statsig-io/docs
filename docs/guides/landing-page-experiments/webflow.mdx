## Webflow set up

To add the script in Webflow, you can open the **Pages** tab on the left, and click the 'Settings' gear icon next to the landing page.  In there, within the 'Custom Code' section, add the script snippet **Inside &lt;head&gt; tag**

A working prototype is available here: https://ab-testing-website.webflow.io/

## Webflow "lite" set up

A more light-weight version of running multiple user experiences in Webflow.

The [Webflow adapter](https://github.com/statsig-io/webflowAdapter) allows you to run an AB test via Webflow's built in `Tabs` component.
Without having to set up entire landing pages, you can configure 2 different variations and control them with Statsig feature flags.
