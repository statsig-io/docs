The Statsig Contentful integration lets you create A/B/n tests and test different content blocks against each other directly from within Contentful. You can assess impact using business metrics on Statsig Cloud or Warehouse Native. Marketers can optimize content, obtain insights, and iterate continuously right from within Contentful.
- Run experiments on CMS content without engineering involvement
- Configure content to serve with each variation
- No performance penalty or flicker
The Statsig Contentful app will add a Statsig container that is connected to an experiment in Statsig. The user can then add Content Blocks to that container to start a test. The Statsig Contentful app lets marketers measure progress towards business objectives by testing content for lift in any core business metrics configured in Statsig.

Coming soon: This is currently in development and will be updated to include screenshots
