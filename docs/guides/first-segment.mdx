title: Reusable Targeting with User Segments

User Segments allow you to predefine targeting groups for re-use in Feature Gates and Dynamic Configs. Think of it as a reusable macro for a set of users.
Need an easy way to roll things out to just your team/org/company? Create a segment, and use a "User is in Segment" or "User is not in Segment" condition
in a Feature Gate or Dynamic Config. Let's go through an example. This guide will walk through creating an example segment to identify our internal users, and then using that segment in a new feature we are building.

## Step 1: Creating a Segment

Start by navigating to the "Segments" tab in the console:

Then click "Create New." Lets call it "Internal Stakeholders:"

There are two types of segments:
- "Conditional Segments" which operate on a similar set of conditions as Feature Gates and Dynamic Configs
- ID Lists, which allow you to predetermine larger lists of userIDs or a particular customID to pass the segment.

For now, lets create a conditional segment, and click "Create."

We will start by adding a condition to target people on our internal environments:

Notice that unlike a Feature Gate, you cannot configure the pass percentage for a rule.  Segments are meant to represent all of the users matching a certain set of rules, but when you create a Feature Gate rule based on a segment, you can configure the pass percentage there.  We will get there in a moment.

Next, lets add another condition to that same rule. Click "Add more conditions", and then use an "email" "contains any of" condition to target internal employees:

:::info
NOTE: Adding an additional condition to the same rule enforces that both pass - the conditions are ANDed together.  If you wish to create multiple conditions where any of them can pass, you can create an OR by adding a new rule.

Don't forget to "Save Changes" after adding those! Your Segment should look like this:

## Step 2: Using a segment

Now, lets make a gate for our new feature, "Landing Page Redesign". Navigate to "Feature Gates" and click "Create New"

![Screen Shot 2022-06-27 at 8 53 04 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/175983618-973a9f36-e1c0-4fd6-9b4a-b97fe658156f.png)

Since this feature isn't ready for the public, lets gate it to our internal stakeholders using the Segment we just created.

Click "Add New Rule"

Again, remember to "Save Changes"

![Screen Shot 2022-06-27 at 8 53 44 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/175983838-e40b4284-af26-4e40-83fc-f2350d9d6fb1.png)

## Step 3: Test it!

Fill in the test gate console with any random user input. You won't be able to get this gate to pass until you pass in a user with an email ending
in `statsig.com` or `statsig.io` AND a `development` or `staging` environment like this. If you remove either of those, you should see it fail.

```
{
  email: 'tore@statsig.com',
  statsigEnvironment: {
    tier: "development"
  }
}
```

There you have it! You can reuse this Segment in as many Feature Gates or Dynamic Configs as you want to gate your internal features while they are under development.
