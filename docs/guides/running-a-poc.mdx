### Overview

At Statsig, we encourage customers to evaluate us by running a proof of concept (POC). This typically involves implementing and running a controlled evaluation of your specific use case – Examples include: rolling out a feature, running an A/B test on your web app, or analyzing the results of a historical experiment using data in your warehouse. Conveniently, any work you do during a POC will not go to waste, and your entire Statsig project and implementation will remain in place throughout the process of becoming Statsig customer and can be continue to be used in your production environment. We will partner with you throughout this process to ensure you are able to prove out the viability of Statsig as your chosen solution – you can reach out [here](https://www.statsig.com/contact/demo) to begin your evaluation.
