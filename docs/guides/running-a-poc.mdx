title: Running a Proof of Concept

### Introduction

At Statsig, we encourage customers to try us out by running a proof of concept (POC) or a limited test. Typically, this involves implementing 1-2 low-risk features or experiments. This guide suggests some planning steps to assist in running an effective proof of concept.

### Steps to Running an Effective Proof of Concept with Statsig

Running a meaningful proof of concept requires some planning.

![POC Timeline](/img/poc_timeline.png)

#### 1. Plan: Define Your Overall Goals & Measures of Success

First, determine **why** you're creating a POC and how you'll measure its success. A solution is only as good as the problem it solves. Make sure you target effective success measures.

Examples:

- “We want to start building out an experimentation platform and have a few ideas for early test experiments."
- “Our internal feature flagging tool doesn’t have scheduled rollouts, and we can't measure the impact. We'd like to test Statsig’s feature flagging solution on our new web service.”
- “I want to see if Statsig’s stats engine will free up data scientist time for more sophisticated analysis.”

Once you’ve set your goals, target 1-2 low-risk features or experiments to validate the platform.

Examples:

- “I want to test two new website layouts against the current one through an A/B/C test to validate an increase in user engagement.”
- “We want to roll out a new search algorithm and measure its performance impact.”
- “We’ve run experiments before and want to validate their results using your stats engine.”

#### 2. Phase 0: Scope & Prepare Your POC

Now that you have clear goals and success measures, it's time to plan out how to achieve them.

When choosing **what** to POC, consider:

- What path allows for easy Statsig implementation while testing the necessary capabilities?
- What does your near-term experimentation roadmap look like?
- Are there common testing areas in your app that would be a good fit?

**Who** will work on this POC?

Statsig is collaborative, involving data, engineering, and product stakeholders. In smaller organizations, one person may handle multiple roles.

**Typical Role Breakdown:**

- **Engineer/Data**: Responsible for implementation and orchestration, including SDK integration, data pipelining, and analysis.
- **Product**: In charge of planning and executing features/experiments and validating test results.

**Consider the Tech Stack:** Make sure the parts of your tech stack that will host the solution are supported by Statsig, whether client, server, or mobile applications.

**Define the Timeline:** We recommend a timeline of 2-4 weeks for the proof of concept.

**Example Timeline:**

- **Weeks 1-2:**
  - Instrument the Statsig SDK into your app.
  - Set up metric ingestion pipelines.
  - Begin rollouts.

- **Weeks 3-4:**
  - Finalize rollouts.
  - Collect data.
  - Analyze results.
  - Finalize the POC.

**Get Help When You Need It:** Join our [Slack community](https://statsig.com/community) to interact with engineers and data scientists, or browse [our documentation](https://docs.statsig.com).

- [Logging Events](/guides/logging-events)

#### 3. Phase 1: Implementation Steps

Now that you're familiar with the platform, it's time to implement Statsig.

Here’s a general overview of the Statsig platform:

![architecture-w-statsig](/img/statsig_architecture.png)

- **Metric Ingestion into Statsig:** If you haven't yet, you’ll need to set up metric ingestion. We provide multiple options:
  - [Server](/server/introduction), [Client SDKs](/client/introduction), and [HTTP API](/http-api)
  - [Integrations](/integrations/introduction)
  - [Data Warehouse Ingestion](/data-warehouse-ingestion/introduction)
  - [Warehouse Native Solution](/statsig-warehouse-native/introduction) (Enterprise only)

  Check the [Metrics Dashboard](/metrics/console) to debug any ingestion issues.

- **Set up Feature Gates / Experiments in the Console:** Decide who the users will be, what metrics to track, and where the code will be deployed. Use the following guides for help:
  - [Build your first feature](/guides/first-feature#step-1---create-a-new-feature-gate)
  - [Your first A/B test](/guides/abn-tests)

- **Implement Feature Flags / Experiments in Your App:** Integrate Statsig’s SDKs into your software and verify the implementation with [testing guides](/guides/testing).

#### 4. Phase 2: Rollout & Test

Deploy your changes through your internal CI/CD pipeline or equivalent. After deployment, monitor exposure data via the [diagnostics tabs](/feature-flags/test-gate#3-using-diagnostics-tab).

For more information, see:

- [Best Practices: Deployment of Feature Gates](/feature-flags/best-practices#development)
- [Product Experimentation Best Practices](https://statsig.com/blog/product-experimentation-best-practices)

#### 5. Phase 3: Collect Data & Read Results

After rolling out Statsig, wait for 2 weeks for data collection. Use the [metrics dashboard](/metrics/console) to track progress, and ensure your [health checks](/experiments-plus/monitor#monitoring-experiment-health) are passing.

You can:
- [Monitor experiments](/experiments-plus/monitor)
- [Read experiment results](/experiments-plus/read-results)

#### 6. Phase 4: Validate Statsig’s Engine

We encourage you to validate the results by exporting the data and comparing it with your internal tools.

- [Validating Data](/integrations/data-exports/overview#validating-data)
- [Statsig Stats Engine](/stats-engine#statsig-stats-engine)

#### Next Steps

If your evaluation shows that Statsig is a good fit, follow our guide to [roll out Statsig to production](/guides/production).
