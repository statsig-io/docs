This page shows each change to a given config and the time that change was published.

For Feature Gates and Dynamic Configs, there is also a "Preview" and "Restore" option. These are meant to make it easy to revert to a previous state, particularly if you start rolling something out that is causing issues in production. The "preview" action will show a diff view between the current state of the gate and the previous state you selected, so you can make sure you are reverting to the correct state.

:::info Note that changes in nested configs are not listed (e.g. if this gate references another gate or segment via a "Passes Target Gate" or "User in Segment" condition, changes to the other gate or segment will not show in the history view.
