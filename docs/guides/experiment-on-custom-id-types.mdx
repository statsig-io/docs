title: Experiment on custom Unit ID Types
---

Sometimes you may want to randomize experiment bucketing based on a Unit ID other than the user ID or the Statsig-generated Stable ID. For example, if your company builds task management tools for other companies, you may need to run an experiment that tests different experiences at the **company level** rather than for individual users. In this case, you’d want the Unit ID to be `companyID` instead of `userID`, so that all users within the same company are placed in the same experimental group.

This is helpful when you want to evaluate the impact of different experiences on a company’s overall productivity, rather than just on individual users.

### Use Cases:
- **Company-level experiments**: As in the example above, this approach helps you understand how changes affect entire organizations rather than individuals.
- **Team-level experiments**: You can apply the same logic to any group of users (e.g., `teamID`, `projectID`).

You can set up experiments with custom Unit IDs in three simple steps. Below, we'll use `companyID` as an example, but you can replace it with any custom ID that fits your use case.

> **Note**: The same steps also work for feature gates, allowing you to partially roll out a feature using custom Unit IDs.

## Step 1: Add `companyID` as a Custom Unit ID in Project Settings

1. **Log into the Statsig Console**  
   Head to the [Statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/) and navigate to **Project Settings** from the top-right panel. Then find the **Custom Unit IDs** section under the **Basic Settings** tab.

2. **Add `companyID` as a New ID Type**  
   By default, every project includes **User ID** and **Stable ID** types. To add a custom Unit ID type:
   - Click **Edit**.
   - Add the new ID type and a description.

   > **Tip**: Once added, the new ID type can be used in any future experiments. You won’t need to repeat this step.

## Step 2: Select `companyID` as the ID Type for Your Experiment

1. **Create a New Experiment**  
   When setting up the experiment, select `companyID` from the **ID Type** dropdown.

2. **Complete Experiment Setup**  
   Now, finish configuring the experiment just as you would for a [user-level experiment](./abn-tests). You can define experiment groups, metrics, and other settings as needed.

## Step 3: Provide `companyID` in the Statsig SDK

To ensure the experiment buckets users by `companyID`, make sure this custom ID is provided in the Statsig SDK. You’ll do this by passing `companyID` in the `customIDs` field of the Statsig user object.

- For client-side SDKs, provide `companyID` during initialization.
- For server-side SDKs, pass `companyID` when fetching experiment configs or logging events.

### Example (Client SDK):

```jsx
var user = {
    userID: "some_user_id",
    customIDs: {
        companyID: "some_company_id",
        // Other custom IDs if needed
    },
    // Other user fields
};
```

> **Note**: The `customIDs` field is a dictionary where each key is the custom Unit ID type (like `companyID`) and the value is the specific ID for that user.

---

That's it! Your experiment will now bucket users based on `companyID` instead of `userID`. This approach ensures that users from the same company or group are assigned the same experience.
