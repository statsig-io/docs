## Introduction

Framer allows you to create interactive prototypes and websites with ease. By integrating Statsig, you can capture user behavior, and log custom events, directly within your Framer projects.

This guide will walk you through integrating Statsig into your Framer project using the JavaScript SDK.

## Installation

To start tracking user interactions with Statsig in your Framer project, follow these steps:

1. Copy your web snippet from Statsig, replacing "YOUR_CLIENT_KEY" with a Client API Key from your Statsig project, which you can find at [console.statsig.com/api_keys](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@statsig/js-client@3/build/statsig-js-client+session-replay+web-analytics.min.js?apikey=[YOUR_CLIENT_KEY]"></script>
```
Go to your Framer project settings by clicking the gear icon in the top right corner - note you'll have to be on the "mini" site plan or above above to enable custom code.
In the General tab, scroll down to the Custom Code section and paste your Statsig snippet into the end of `<head>` tag section. Save your changes and publish your site, then Statsig will be ready to track basic user interactions.

## Capture Custom Events
To track custom events within your Framer project, you can use window.statsig.logEvent() inside a custom component.

Go to the Assets tab in your Framer project.
Click the plus icon next to Code and create a new code component.
Name the file CaptureButton and select New Component.
Replace the default code in the file with the following:

```js

export default function CaptureButton() {
    const handleClick = () => {
        window.statsig.logEvent("click", "button");
    };

    return (
        <button id="capture-button" onClick={handleClick}>
            Click me
        </button>
    );
}
```
Save your changes (Cmd/Ctrl + S).
Drag your new CaptureButton component from the Code tab onto your Framer page, where you'd like it.
After publishing your site and clicking the button, after a couple minutes you should see the event show up in your Statsig metrics.
