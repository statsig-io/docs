title: Build your first Device-level Experiment

When you cannot identify a user via their user ID, device-level experiments allow you to randomize experiments based on a _stable ID_ stored locally on the user's device. This stable ID is automatically generated by Statsig and ensures consistent evaluations across sessions for anonymous users.

Device-level experiments are ideal in scenarios such as:
- **Anonymous or first-time users**: When users haven't signed in yet or are browsing anonymously.
- **Cross-device consistency**: Ensuring the same experience on the same device, regardless of user sign-in status.

You can implement a device-level experiment almost exactly like a traditional user-level experiment. The key difference is setting the experiment’s ID type to **Stable ID**.

### Step 1: Create a Device-level Experiment

1. **Log into the Statsig Console**: Visit [Statsig Console](https://console.statsig.com/) and navigate to **Experiments+** on the left-hand sidebar.
   
2. **Create a New Experiment**:
    - Click on **Create** and fill out the **name** and **description** of your experiment.
    - Enable the **Use Stable ID** option during setup.
    - Click **Create** to proceed.

3. **Define Experiment Metrics**: Add a hypothesis, primary metrics, and secondary metrics in the **Scorecard** section, just like you would for a user-level experiment.

4. **Set Groups and Parameters**:
    - In the **Groups** section, define the parameters for your experiment. For instance, you can experiment with a simple boolean parameter like `"enabled"`.

5. **Set Allocation**:
    - By default, the experiment targets 100% of your user base. Adjust the allocation if needed. Starting with a smaller rollout is often recommended until you're confident in the new variant.

6. **Save and Start**: Once everything is configured, click **Save** to finalize your experiment. When you're ready to launch, click **Start** to roll it out.

### Step 2: Initialize the SDK in Your Application

After setting up your experiment in the Statsig console, the next step is to integrate it into your client application using one of Statsig’s SDKs.

Here’s an example of how to initialize the SDK in a **Javascript** application. The client SDK automatically generates a stable ID, so you don’t need to pass a `user ID` unless available.

#### Example (JavaScript):

```javascript
const user = {
    ip: "192.168.1.101",   // Optional user properties
    appVersion: "1.0.0",
    custom: {
        promoCode: "New30Off"
    }
};

// Initialize the Statsig Client
const client = new StatsigClient(sdkKey, user, {
  environment: { tier: "production" }  // Optional environment settings
});

await client.initializeAsync();
```

**Key points**:
- **No User ID**: You don’t need to pass a user ID for device-level experiments. The SDK generates a stable ID automatically.
- **User attributes**: You can pass additional attributes like `ip`, `appVersion`, and `custom` properties for experiment targeting.

> **Tip**: If your app collects other relevant attributes (e.g., device type, region), pass them in the `user` object to improve experiment precision.

### Step 3 (Optional): Update User Info for Logged-in Users

If a user signs in or creates an account, you can update the user info using the `updateUserAsync()` method. This ensures the user is bucketed into the appropriate user-based experiments without affecting their device-level experiment evaluation.

#### Example (JavaScript):

```javascript
user.userID = realUserID;
user.email = signUpEmail;

// Update the user object
await client.updateUserAsync(user);
```

> **Note**: Updating the user with a `userID` will only impact user-level experiments and feature gates. Device-level experiment evaluations will remain based on the stable ID.
