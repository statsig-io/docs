title: Build your first Device-level Experiment

In cases where you're unable to establish the user's identity and are unable to leverage a user ID as the unit of randomization for your experiment,
Statsig's _device-level_ experiments enable you to design experiments using a Statsig-generated stable ID, saved on the user's device.

Setting up a _device-level_ experiment is the same as creating a traditional _user-level_ experiment except that you simply have to click the **Use Device ID** check box when you create the experiment and do **not** need to pass the user ID when initializing the client SDK in your application if you don't have it yet.

### Step 1 - Create a new experiment in the Statsig console

Log into the Statsig console at https://console.statsig.com/ and navigate to Experiments+ in the left-hand navigation panel.

Click on the Create button and enter the name and description for your experiment. Click the checkbox for **Use Stable ID** check box and click **Create**.

By default, each experiment runs in its own layer. When you want to create an experiment that excludes any users exposed to other experiments, you will also want to click the checkbox for **Add Layer**. As this is our first experiment, enabling this isolation isn't relevant for us at this stage. 

In the experiment **Setup** tab, under the **Allocation** panel enter the percentage of users that you want to allocate to this experiment. As this experiment will run in its own layer and you can enter a value up to 100%.

Staying in the experiment **Setup** tab, under the **Variations** panel, enter the variant names and click on **Add Another Variant** to enter more variants. You'll find that the split percentages between these variants automatically change to evenly distribute users between these variants.

Staying in the **Variations** panel, click on the pencil icon next the _sample_parameter_ and enter the name of your experiment parameter and the type, and click **Confirm**

Enter the values that the experiment parameter will take for the control and treatment groups.

Enter the key metrics you want to track in this experiment

Don't forget to click on the **Save** button at the top right hand side of the page to complete your experiment setup.


### Step 2 - Use your experiment configuration in the client-side of your application

Once you have installed a client SDK of your choice (see [Javascript example](https://docs.statsig.com/client/jsClientSDK)),
you must `initialize` the SDK using your client SDK key as shown below.
For device-level experiments, you do **not** have to include the user ID as you would with more traditional experiments if the user is not yet known/signed-in.

```jsx
const user = {
    ip: "192.168.1.101",
    appVersion: "1.0.0",
    custom: {
        promoCode: "New30Off",
    }
};

await statsig.initialize('client-sdk-key', user);
```

### Step 3 (Optional) - Add user identifiers for other experiments involving signed-in users

Once the user creates an account or logs into your application, you can also call the `updateUser` API with user ID and any other new user attributes as shown below.

```jsx
user.userID = realUserID;
user.email = signUpEmail;

await statsig.updateUser(user);
```
