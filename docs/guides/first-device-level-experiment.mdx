title: Build your first Device-level Experiment

In cases where you're unable to establish the user's identity and are unable to leverage a user ID as the unit of randomization for your experiment,
Statsig's *device-level* experiments enable you to design experiments using a Statsig-generated stable ID, called the **Device ID**, based on the user's device. 

Setting up a *device-level* experiment is the same as creating a traditional *user-level* experiment except that you simply have to click the **Device ID** check box when you create the experiment and **not** pass the user ID when initializing the client SDK in your application. 


### Step 1 - Create a new experiment in the Statsig console

Log into the Statsig console at https://console.statsig.com/ and navigate to Experiments+ in the left-hand navigation panel.

Click on the Create button and enter the name, description, and hypothesis for your experiment. 
You may optionally select a targeting gate if you wish to limit eligibility for the experiment using an existing feature gate.

Click the **Use Device ID** check box at the bottom and click Next.

Enter the parameters that will change between control and treatment groups and click Next.

By default, each experiment runs in its own layer. You can choose to select a specific layer or leave the experiment in the default layer.  
Set the paramter values for the control and treatment groups in the experiment, add more groups if necessary, and click Next.

Select the key metrics that you want to use to validate your hypothesis, and click Create.

### Step 2 - Use your experiment configuration in the client-side of your application

Once you have installed a client SDK of your choice (see [Javascript example](https://docs.statsig.com/client/jsClientSDK)), 
you must ``initialize`` the SDK using your client SDK key as shown below. 
For device-level experiments, you do **not** have to include the user ID as you would with more traditional experiments.

{<Initialize />}

### Step 3 (Optional) - Add user identifiers for other experiments involving signed-in users

Once the user creates an account or logs into your application, you can also call the ``updateUser`` API with user ID and any other user attributes as shown below.

{<UpdateUser />}
