# Features you should be using on Statsig

## Single Sign On (SSO)
### ⚠️ Security risk if not enabled 
If you've not enabled SSO on Statsig, your ex-employees will be able to make changes in your Statsig project, unless you remember to deactivate them in Statsig. Using SSO makes sure they cannot access Statsig when you remove their user account from your systems (by forcing them to authenticate with your systems frequently).

## Require Change Review
### ⚠️ Production systems at risk if not enabled
Like with changes to your source code or production configuration, requiring a second pair of eyes to review changes in Statsig helps reduces mistakes in production. When enabled, changes impacting only pre-production environments do not require approval - allowing agiity there. You can grant admins or oncalls the ability to self-approve changes if desired. If you choose to ignore this recommendation, consider enabling change review and granting all members the ability to self-approve changes, so they clearly see the change they're committing before doing so.

## Tags for organization
Tags let you apply light-weight organization to your Statsig config (e.g. gates, experiments and metrics) to allow easy filtering by team (or organization objectives). E.g. You can tag growth related experiments and metrics with a tag called "Growth", easily filtering down to just these when needed. This is particularly usesful with metrics - since you can now just add the Growth tag to your scorecard metrics, and pull in all the key Growth metrics instead of individually picking them.

The Core tag is meant to be used for company critical metrics. These are defaulted into experiment scorecards so experiemnters are looking at impact on these metrics as part of their experiments.
