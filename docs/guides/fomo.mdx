# Single Sign On (SSO)
## ⚠️Not enabling this is a security vulnerability 
If you've not enabled SSO on Statsig, your ex-employees will be able to make changes in your Statsig project, unless you remember to deactivate them in Statsig. Using SSO makes sure they cannot access Statsig when you remove their user account from your systems (by forcing them to authenticate with your systems frequently). (https://docs.statsig.com/access-management/sso/overview)
