title: Testing on Statsig
---

Statsig increases your engineering velocity. This page has pointers to features across the product that enable you to test while moving fast. 

Overrides: Testing a specific feature or experiment
You can create overrides for [features](https://docs.statsig.com/feature-gates/overrides#adding-an-override), [experiments](https://docs.statsig.com/experiments-plus/overrides) or [holdouts](https://docs.statsig.com/holdouts). Overrides are excluded from analysis in Pulse results so they don't bias results. Experiments overrides can include Segments that target pre-prod environments or employees.
