Statsig enhances your engineering velocity by offering tools and features that allow you to test configurations quickly while ensuring reliable outcomes. This page highlights key features across the product to help you test efficiently.

## Overrides: Testing a Specific Feature or Experiment

Overrides enable you to manually configure [features](/feature-flags/overrides#adding-an-override), [experiments](/experiments-plus/overrides), or [holdouts](/holdouts) for testing purposes. This allows you to test without affecting live production data or skewing experiment results. Overrides are **excluded from Pulse analysis** to prevent biased results.

- You can use **Segments** to target overrides to pre-production environments or specific groups, such as employees, for testing purposes.

## Unit Tests

Statsig's **Server SDKs** provide a `localMode` feature that prevents the SDK from accessing the network, making it ideal for unit testing. This ensures your tests run in isolation and do not send any data to production.

When `localMode` is enabled, the SDK returns default values, allowing you to mock features and experiments in your test environments.

### Override APIs for Testing
You can use the `overrideGate` and `overrideConfig` APIs to set overrides for specific users or globally.

```js
function overrideGate(
    gateName: string,
    value: boolean,
    userID?: string,
): void;
```

```js
function overrideConfig(
    configName: string,
    value: object,
    userID?: string,
): void
```

For example, to override a gate for testing purposes, you could call:

```js
statsig.overrideGate("example_gate", true);
```

- For detailed usage, refer to [Node.js Server SDK](/server/nodejsServerSDK#how-can-i-mock-statsig-for-testing) or the [JavaScript Client SDK](/client/javascript-sdk#testing).

## Environments

Statsig allows you to set environments for feature and experiment checks. By default, Statsig assumes all checks without an explicitly defined environment are for **Production**. You can assign environments (such as Development, Staging, or Production) to checks, metrics, and events, and target these environments in your **Feature Gates** or **Segments**.

- Non-production events are visible in diagnostics but are excluded from Pulse results, ensuring only production data is considered in the final analysis.

### Mapping Custom Environments
You can either use the built-in environments in Statsig (Development, Staging, Production) or map your own custom environments. Some customers choose to create a **logical mapping**, such as:
- Mapping Dev One boxes to **Development**.
- Assigning an **Early Access** slice (e.g., 1% of production users) to **Production** for more controlled releases.
