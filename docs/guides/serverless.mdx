In this guide, we will walk you through how to leverage Statsigâ€™s platform in serverless environments.  The examples in this guide use the `statsig-node` SDK in a Google Cloud Function.
These details shouldn't matter - but you may have to adjust your implementation based on your cloud provider of choice.

### Usage

Statsig server SDKs can be used in serverless environments.  If you are unable to `initialize` Statsig outside of a serverless function, you will incur a server round trip to Statsig servers to initialize the SDK in every function.

After this point, all checks should be locally evaluated in the function.

Finally, you'll need to ensure any enqueued events (exposure and custom events) are flushed to Statsig prior to the function exiting. You'll need to call `statsig.flush()` as demonstrated [here](/server/nodejsServerSDK#flushing-events-) using the Cloudflare flavor. 

### Example

The following example has some debugging information built in to show the cost of initializing the SDK in a cloud function.  In our experience, the `initialize` call takes less than a second, and subsequent function invocations should proceed without this startup cost.

import Gist from 'react-gist';

<Gist id="bc759e43fd3fbac4619e5635d8ba9353" />


### Alternatives

If this doesn't work for you, a custom integration may help but would require additional setup.

For example, you could create a background function which fetches your definitions from Statsig servers periodically, and stores them in your database.
Then, when initializing a Statsig server SDK, you can fetch the values from your database, rather than issuing a request to Statsig servers.

### Fastly Implementation

Depending on your Fastly account settings, you may have an extra layer of security enabled which requires a custom `fetch` method to be implemented for any network requests that need to be made to 3rd party domains. You must implement a custom `fetch` method that uses Fastly's required [backend parameter](https://js-compute-reference-docs.edgecompute.app/docs/globals/fetch).

To solve for this, first define a module in its own file that implements a global override of `fetch`:
<Gist id="b5d09f889465021f999582d1f48ef187" />

Next, in the main function entrypoint, simply import the fetch override module prior to importing the Statsig SDK:
<Gist id="f4a61c369ea03b24ffb8aecb9175bdcb" />
