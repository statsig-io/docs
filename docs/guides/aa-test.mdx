In this guide, we will walk you through how to leverage Statsig’s platform to run an A/A test on your product.  

:::info This guide assumes that you have successfully set up and configured your Statsig SDK. For a step-by-step guide on how to do this, see our [“Your first feature”](/guides/first-feature) guide.

## Why run an A/A (aa) test?  

There are many reasons to run an A/A test, one of the most common being to validate a new experimentation engine you may be integrating with (in this case Statsig).  For new users just getting started with Statsig, we often recommend running an A/A test to provide a “low-stakes” first test environment, ensuring that you’ve got your metrics set up correctly and are seeing exposures flowing through as expected before kicking off your first real A/B test. 

Here at Statsig, we are continuously running both live and offline simulation A/A tests on our stats engine- if you want to check one out for yourself, see this example in our Swaggr Demo Project!  

## How to run an A/A test

The easiest way to run an A/A test in Statsig is by leveraging a [Feature Flag](/feature-flags/working-with). You can also leverage an [Experiment](/guides/abn-tests) to run an A/A, but we chose to use a Feature Gate for this tutorial for simplicity. 

## Step 1: Create a new feature gate in the Statsig console

Log into the Statsig console at https://console.statsig.com/ and navigate to **Feature Gates** in the left-hand navigation panel.

Click on the **Create** button and enter the name and (optional) description for your feature gate. We will call our feature gate “aatest_example”. Click **Create**.

In the Setup tab, define the rules for this feature gate. Tap **+ Add New Rule**. While you could run an A/A test on a specific user-group, platform, etc. the easiest setup is to simply divide all of your traffic 50/50 and deliver the same experience (your default product experience) to each group.

![add_new_rule_empty](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101903926/163247089-360857f8-ada3-46af-ac82-e41fc99274b5.png)


To do this, under **Criteria** select **Everyone** (you may need to scroll up), name your rule, and then change the **Pass Percentage** to 50%. Click **Add Rule** and that’s it! Tap **Save Changes** in the upper right-hand corner.  

![add_new_rule_filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101903926/163247141-30c96f8a-8257-4b39-aa9f-830bb3c89228.png)

Your feature gate setup should now look as follows-

Check that it is working as expected by typing in some dummy user IDs into the console- roughly 50% of the time your IDs should pass, and 50% of the time they should fail.  

![check_rule_pass](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101903926/163247281-c0fb8089-f418-41af-a3a7-d8e684a3cdf3.png)

![check_rule_fail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101903926/163247287-7d565983-8253-4841-a65a-0f74d2e103b2.png)

## Step 2: Check the feature gate in your application and log an event 

Copy the code snippet in the upper right hand corner of your feature gate page under the **< >** symbol and drop it into your application at the point you want to call the A/A check.  

```jsx
statsig.checkGate("aatest_example") 
```

Now when a user renders this page in their client application, you will automatically start to see a live log stream in the Statsig console when you navigate to the **Diagnostics** tab for your feature gate. 

![logstream](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101903926/163247712-4610d7b4-188f-4418-a696-127b3c2f54da.png)

## Step 3: Review A/A test results 

Within 24 hours of starting your experiment, you'll see the cumulative exposures in the **Pulse Results** tab of your feature gate. 

![cumulative_exposures](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101903926/163247787-be1e816c-f715-4fd3-ad59-3a6caf48027a.png)

This will break down your logged exposures (as well as the distribution of the logged exposures). If something looks off, check the **Diagnostics** tab for more granular, day-by-day exposure breakdowns at both the Checks and User level.  

In the **Metric Lifts** panel, you can see the full picture of how all your tagged metrics are performing.  


![pulse_results_empty](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101903926/163248267-7bd7419a-59e0-4d58-b8e5-8ace95ed74d9.png)

What should you expect to see?  

* **Exposures**- make sure you’re seeing exposures flowing through as expected from your product. If you’re not seeing exposures, use the **Diagnostics** tab and the **Exposure Stream** to debug  
* **Pulse results**- roughly 5% of your metrics in Pulse should be showing a statistically significant change due to the 95% confidence interval of Statsig’s stats engine 

We recommend running your A/A long enough to reach most of your weekly active users, or at least a week.
