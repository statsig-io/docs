title: Taking your experiments to production

With the experiment configuration out of the way, we need to take this to production.  Sidecar makes this easy with just a few clicks.

:::info
This guide assumes you have followed the previous steps of creating an experiment in Sidecar.  Check out [Creating Experiments](./creating-experiments) for those instructions.

### Step 1: Publish the experiments

Once you are satisfied with the experiment configuration, go ahead and hit the green *Publish* button.  This will push all the experiment changes to Statsig.  If you want to make sure these changes are published, you can on the `...` menu and choose *Go to Experiment console*

The experiment console will look like this, and allows you to configure rich targeting, metrics, and tweak advanced statistical knobs.  More on this later.

### Step 2: Add script code

Now that you have created and configured your first experiment, all that remains is to activate it on your website.  You will need to add a single line of code in the &lt;HEAD&gt; portion of your website.  

There are many ways to add this script code to your website.  Most website builders will allow you to add script tags on your website.  Here are some common website builder examples:

* [Webflow](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/custom-code-in-the-head-and-body-tags?topics=site-settings)
* [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/go/website-building/how-to-properly-add-javascript-to-wordpress-3-top-methods/)
* [Wix](https://support.wix.com/en/article/embedding-custom-code-on-your-site)
* [Squarespace](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205815928-Adding-custom-code-to-your-site)
* [Weebly](https://weeblytutorials.com/embed-javascript-weebly)

The code itself would look like this with your API Key switched.

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/statsig-sidecar/dist/index.min.js?apikey=client-xxx"></script>
```

### Step 3: Start the experiment

Refresh the page on your browser with the script embedded.  Sidecar will automatically pick up the experiment you have published and display all the experiment properties.

You can now start the experiment by clicking on the `...` menu and clicking on *Start Experiment*.  This will automatically start the experiment, serve the right variants for control and test, and start collecting metrics on your behalf.

### Congratulations!  You have successfully built and shipped an experiment &#x1F389;
