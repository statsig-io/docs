## Overview

A/B testing, or split testing, is a fundamental method in digital marketing for validating various strategies and website designs. It involves comparing two versions of a webpage to see which performs better with a target audience. 

Traditionally, implementing A/B tests required substantial technical skills, often necessitating collaboration between marketers and developers. This could lead to longer implementation times, impacting the agility of marketing initiatives. 

Statsig Sidecar is a low-code tool that simplifies this process, enabling marketers to independently execute A/B tests with more ease and less technical dependency.  It provides an intuitive interface, making it super-easy to set up and manage A/B tests for your website. This change enhances the speed and frequency at which tests can be conducted, allowing for quicker iteration and adaptation in marketing strategies. 

You can experiment with different elements like styling, text content, calls to action, and even inject scripts that change behavior of the page. You can then assess what works best with your audience. 

This rapid testing and feedback process is crucial for fine-tuning and ensuring that the website aligns well with user preferences and behavior patterns.

Combined with the most powerful statistical engine, Sidecar helps you in making data-driven decisions and understanding the impact of various website elements on user behavior. These insights are valuable for not just validating current strategies but also for informing future marketing decisions.

## A Word on performance

Sidecar (along with any type of client side tooling you install, be it open-source or via experimentation providers) will introduce some degree of page load latency. We recommend taking Sidecar for a spin and determining if the impact of your performance metrics fall within your acceptable threshold.

Customers that are very performance-minded typically use our [JS-SDK](/client/javascript-sdk) for testing on the web. When using the JS/React SDKs with [Client Bootstrapping](/client/javascript-sdk/init-strategies/#2-bootstrap-initialization), the latency introduced is very minimal since there are no network requests required for initialization.
