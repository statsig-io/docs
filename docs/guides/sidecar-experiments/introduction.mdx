## Overview

A/B testing, or split testing, is a fundamental method in digital marketing for validating website changes. It involves comparing two versions of a webpage to see which performs better with a target audience. 

Traditionally, implementing A/B tests required substantial technical skills, often necessitating collaboration between marketers and developers - leading to longer implementation times and reduced agility of marketing teams.

## Statsig's visual editor

Statsig's Visual Editor simplifies this process, enabling marketers to independently execute A/B tests with limited technical dependency. It provides an intuitive, point-and-shoot interface, making it easy to set up and manage A/B tests on your website. You can experiment on styling, text content, calls to action, and even inject scripts that change page behavior.

This rapid testing and feedback process is crucial for fine-tuning your website and ensuring it's optimized for user preferences and behavior patterns.

Combined with Statsig's [industry-leading stats engine](/experiments-plus), Sidecar is a powerful tool in a marketer's toolkit.

## A word on performance

Sidecar (along with any type of client side tooling you install, be it open-source or via experimentation providers) will introduce some degree of page load latency. We recommend taking Sidecar for a spin and determining if the impact of your performance metrics fall within your acceptable threshold.

Customers that are very performance-minded typically use our [JS-SDK](/client/javascript-sdk) for testing on the web. When using the JS/React SDKs with [Client Bootstrapping](/client/javascript-sdk/init-strategies/#2-bootstrap-initialization), the latency introduced is very minimal since there are no network requests required for initialization.
