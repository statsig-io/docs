## Setup Sidecar Chrome Extension

### Step 1: Install Chrome Extension

If you don't already have the Sidecar extension, visit the [Chrome store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/statsig-sidecar/blkgemeefnlkmicphlkodgdkhceibgcb) and click on the "Add to Chrome" button

### Step 2: Activate the extension

Click on the Extensions toolbar button and select "Statsig Sidecar" to activate the Sidecar extension

You will now see an Experiment Config UI like this:

### Step 3: Update settings

You will need to update API keys in the Settings Dialog for the extension to work.  You can invoke the Settings dialog from the "Settings" link on the top header.

You can retrieve these keys from your Statsig project.  In order to get this, login to Statsig Console here: https://console.statsig.com and navigate to the Settings page (https://console.statsig.com/settings)

Once you're there, select the "Keys & Environments" panel and copy both the Console API Key and Client API Key and paste them in the Settings dialog.

Hit "OK" to commit the API Keys.  

## Install Sidecar on your website

Add a single script tag within the `<head>` portion of your website, replacing with your own [Client SDK Key](https://docs.statsig.com/sdk-keys/api-keys/) as shown below.

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/statsig-sidecar/dist/index.min.js?apikey=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_CLIENT_SDK_KEY"></script>
```

:::info
Installing Sidecar JS via a Tag Manager can potentially lead to flickering and other unpredictable behavior. We strongly encourage installing Sidecar as a synchronous script tag.
:::

### Additional Options
Add these query string parameters to the Sidecar script URL for additional controls over Sidecar client behavior
- `&reduceflicker=0` will disable the brief hiding of the `<body>` tag while the client initializes
- `&autocapture=0` will disable event autocapture

Most website builders also support the ability to add script tags on your website.  Here are some common website builder examples:
[Webflow](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/custom-code-in-the-head-and-body-tags?topics=site-settings)
, [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/go/website-building/how-to-properly-add-javascript-to-wordpress-3-top-methods/)
, [Wix](https://support.wix.com/en/article/embedding-custom-code-on-your-site)
, [Squarespace](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205815928-Adding-custom-code-to-your-site)
, [Weebly](https://weeblytutorials.com/embed-javascript-weebly).

You can copy the script code from within the Sidecar Chrome extension
