### Step 3: Update settings

You will need to update API keys in the Settings Dialog for the extension to work.  You can invoke the Settings dialog from the "Settings" link on the top header.

You can retrieve these keys from your Statsig project.  In order to get this, login to Statsig Console here: https://console.statsig.com and navigate to the Settings page (https://console.statsig.com/settings)

Once you're there, select the "Keys & Environments" panel and copy both the Console API Key and Client API Key and paste them in the Settings dialog.

Hit "OK" to commit the API Keys.
