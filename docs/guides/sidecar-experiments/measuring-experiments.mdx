## Using Autocapture
Sidecar comes loaded with an event collection tool that will autocapture various web activities, allowing you to create both simple and complex Metrics within Statsig console without writing a line of code.

_Autocapture includes:_
* Click events with click target info, current page url (`auto_capture::click`)
* Page View Events with page url and query string values ((`auto_capture::page_view`))
* Page view duration, page scroll depth (`auto_capture::page_view_end`)
* Form Submission Events (`auto_capture::form_submit`)
* Page Performance data (`auto_capture::performance`)

## Setting User Identity and Attributes

By default, Autocapture uses `stableID` (an auto-generated device-level guid that gets stored in the user's localStorage) for tracking purposes. If you wish to enrich autocapture events with known user identities and attributes, you can define the following object _prior_ to autocapture/sidecar being loaded.

```js
window.statsigUser = {
  userID: "<USER ID>",
  custom: { // optional attributes object
     isLoggedIn: false 
  }
}
```

## Using the tracking API

You can track events manually for actions that are not autocaptured by the feature described above. 
To track events back to Statsig, you can call `StatsigSidecar.logEvent` which takes the same arguments as the Statsig JS SDK as documented [here](https://docs.statsig.com/client/jsClientSDK#logging-an-event). This method can be called prior to completion of the init routine. 

```js
// example order event
StatsigSidecar.logEvent('Order', null, {
  total: 54.66,
  units: 3,
  unitAvgCost: 18.22
});
```

## Post-Experiment Callback for outbound integrations
You can bind a callback that gets invoked after Sidecar has run experiments (also gets called when there are no experiments), 
allowing you to run code that processes the experiment assignments as needed.

_This method should be defined anywhere prior to the Sidecar client script._

```js
window.postExperimentCallback = function(statsigClient, experimentIds) {
  /** 
   * add your own callback routine here
   * ie; annotating 3rd party analytics tools with assignment info
      
    var evarValue = [];
    experimentIds.forEach(function(expId) {
      var inExp = statsigClient.getExperimentWithExposureLoggingDisabled(expId).getGroupName();
      if(inExp) {
        evarValue.push(expId + ':' + inExp);
      }
    });
    evarValue = evarValue.join(',');
   */
}
```

## Persisting stableID across subdomains
Statsig uses `localStorage` as the preferred mechanism for storing the user's stableID. Localstorage keys do not persist across any origin boundaries including across subdomains. For example, a user visiting `https://example.com`, `https://show.example.com` and `https://account.example.com` would be issued three distinct stableIDs. 

If you are assigning a user to a test on one subdomain, and tracking behavior for metrics purposes on a different subdomain, you'll need to have this solution in place to ensure Statsig can properly attribute cross-origin behavior to the Test Group assignment that took place on the initial experiment domain. 

To install, simply paste the first script tag shown below directly above your Sidecar script.

```html
<!-- cross domain id script -->
<script>!function(){let t="STATSIG_LOCAL_STORAGE_STABLE_ID";function e(){if(crypto&&crypto.randomUUID)return crypto.randomUUID();let t=()=>Math.floor(65536*Math.random()).toString(16).padStart(4,"0");return`${t()}${t()}-${t()}-4${t().substring(1)}-${t()}-${t()}${t()}${t()}`}let i=null,n=localStorage.getItem(t)||null;if(document.cookie.match(/statsiguuid=([\w-]+);?/)&&([,i]=document.cookie.match(/statsiguuid=([\w-]+);?/)),i&&n&&i===n);else if(i&&n&&i!==n)localStorage.setItem(t,i);else if(i&&!n)localStorage.setItem(t,i);else{let o=e();localStorage.setItem(t,o),function t(i){let n=new Date;n.setMonth(n.getMonth()+12);let o=window.location.host.split(".");o.length>2&&o.shift();let s=`.${o.join(".")}`;document.cookie=`statsiguuid=${i||e()};Expires=${n};Domain=${s}`}(o)}}();</script>
