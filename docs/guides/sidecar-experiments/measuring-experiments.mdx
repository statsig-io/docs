## Using Autocapture
Sidecar comes loaded with an event collection tool that will autocapture various web activities, allowing you to create both simple and complex Metrics within Statsig console without writing a line of code.

See [Autocapture on the Web](/client/concepts/autocapture)


## Using the tracking API

You can track events manually for actions that are not autocaptured by the feature described above. 
To track events back to Statsig, you can call `StatsigSidecar.logEvent` which takes the same arguments as the Statsig JS SDK as documented [here](/client/deprecated/jsClientSDK#event-logging). This method can be called prior to completion of the init routine. 

```js
// example order event
StatsigSidecar.logEvent('Order', null, {
  total: 54.66,
  units: 3,
  unitAvgCost: 18.22
});
```

## Post-Experiment Callback for outbound integrations
You can bind a callback that gets invoked after Sidecar has run experiments (also gets called when there are no experiments), 
allowing you to run code that processes the experiment assignments as needed.

_This method should be defined anywhere prior to the Sidecar client script._

```js
window.postExperimentCallback = function(statsigClient, experimentIds) {
  /** 
   * add your own callback routine here
   * ie; annotating 3rd party analytics tools with assignment info
      
    var evarValue = [];
    experimentIds.forEach(function(expId) {
      var inExp = statsigClient.getExperiment(expId, { disableExposureLog: true }).groupName;
      if(inExp) {
        evarValue.push(expId + ':' + inExp);
      }
    });
    evarValue = evarValue.join(',');
   */
}
```

#### Disabling All Logging
To disable all logging to statsig (both autocapture events and logging who has seen your experiments) append the following query string parameter to the Sidecar script URL: `&autostart=0`. This may be useful if you're dealing with GDPR compliance, and you can later re-enable events with `client.updateRuntimeOptions({disableLogging: false})`
