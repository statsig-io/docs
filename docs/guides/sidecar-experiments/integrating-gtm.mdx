title: Integrating Sidecar with GTM for tracking
---

:::info
This integration is for tracking purposes only. We strongly advise against loading Sidecar itself via GTM, as this will delay the changes from being applied and result in "flickering".
:::

### Overview
This integration with GTM will automatically send any GTM-tagged events to Statsig.<br /> No additional coding or tagging is required after completing these steps.

### Step 1: Create new tag

### Step 5: Save tag and test
After saving the tag, and publishing your updated GTM tag, tracking will be done automatically without any additional configuration.
To debug the integration, you can set a local storage entry `debug_ss_gtm` with any value on your webpage. Now, you'll console log statements for each tracking call being dispatched to Statsig. You can also inspect your browser's network traffic to see events being tracked.
