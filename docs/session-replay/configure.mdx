# Configuration and Limits

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

## Conditional Recording

In the Statsig Console, you can configure your Session Replay settings under **Project Settings → Analytics & Session Replay**. You must be a project admin to modify these settings.

### Global Targeting Gate

The Global Targeting Gate controls who is _eligible_ for session recording. If a user does not pass this gate, their sessions will never be recorded. By default, this is set to Everyone, meaning there are no restrictions—anyone can be recorded. You can think of this as defining the "top of the funnel" for session recording eligibility.

### Global Sampling Rate

The Global Sampling Rate determines what percentage of eligible sessions are recorded from the start. By default, this is set to **100%**, meaning all eligible sessions are recorded automatically. You can lower this if you want to limit session recordings but still ensure a consistent percentage of sessions are always captured. This rate applies only to sessions that begin at the start and does not affect conditional triggers.

### Conditional Triggers: Events and Exposures

Conditional triggers can start a session recording mid-session, even if it wasn’t recorded from the beginning. These triggers respect the Global Targeting Gate but operate independently of the Global Sampling Rate. When triggered, the recording includes the last 30 seconds leading up to the event (if rolling window is enabled).

There are three types of conditional triggers:

- **Gate Exposures** — Trigger based on exposure to a specific gate, optionally filtered by group (e.g., Pass/Fail).
- **Experiment Exposures** — Trigger based on exposure to a specific experiment, optionally filtered by group (e.g., Test/Control).
- **Events** — Trigger based on specific logged event, optionally filtered by event values (e.g., "purchase_event" with value "book").

For each trigger, you can define an individual sampling rate. This rate is evaluated based on session_id, meaning the result (pass or fail) will remain consistent for the same session, even if the trigger occurs multiple times.

Important: If a conditional trigger occurs while a session recording is already in progress, the recording simply continues uninterrupted.

### Example Walkthrough

Suppose you have the following setup (See image above):

- The Global Targeting Gate `session_replay_global_targeting_gate` allows all US users and excludes everyone else.
- The Global Sampling Rate is set to 25%, so only 25% of eligible US user sessions are recorded from the start.
- For the remaining 75% of eligible users, session recording can still begin mid-session if a conditional trigger occurs.

Example Scenario:

1. A US user starts a session. They do not pass the 25% Global Sampling Rate, so their session is not recorded from the beginning.
2. Later, a `purchase_event` occurs with value `book`. This event is set up as a conditional trigger with a 50% sampling rate. If this session fails the sampling rate check, recording does not start.
3. A minute later, the user is exposed to the `cool_new_feature` gate, and the recording begins

Note: A trigger’s sampling rate is consistent for the entire session based on session_id. So if `purchase_event` fails the sampling rate once, future occurrences of the same event in that session will also fail.

### Initialization - StatsigTriggeredSessionReplay

<Tabs
  groupId="session-replay-js-framework"
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    {label: 'js', value: 'js'},
    {label: 'react', value: 'react'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="js">

```jsx
import { StatsigClient } from "@statsig/js-client";
import { runStatsigTriggeredSessionReplay } from "@statsig/session-replay";
import { runStatsigAutoCapture } from "@statsig/web-analytics";

const client = new StatsigClient(
  sdkKey,
  { userID: "some_user_id" },
  { environment: { tier: "production" } } // optional, pass options here if needed
);
runStatsigTriggeredSessionReplay(client, {
  autoStartRecording: true,
  keepRollingWindow: true,
});
runStatsigAutoCapture(client);
await client.initializeAsync();
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="react">

```jsx
import { StatsigProvider, useClientAsyncInit } from "@statsig/react-bindings";
import { StatsigTriggeredSessionReplayPlugin } from "@statsig/session-replay";
import { StatsigAutoCapturePlugin } from "@statsig/web-analytics";

function App() {
  return (
    <StatsigProvider
      sdkKey={YOUR_CLIENT_KEY}
      user={{ userID: "a-user" }}
      loadingComponent={<div>Loading...</div>}
      options={{
        plugins: [
          new StatsigTriggeredSessionReplayPlugin({
            autoStartRecording: true,
            keepRollingWindow: true,
          }),
          new StatsigAutoCapturePlugin(),
        ],
      }}
    >
      <Content />
    </StatsigProvider>
  );
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Initialization Options

- `autoStartRecording`
  - `true`: Recording _can_ start automatically after initialization. Global targeting gate and sample rate are respected
  - `false`: You _must_ manually start recording using startSessionRecording(). This is helpful if you want to start the recording after a set point and block any auto-recording before then
- `keepRollingWindow`
  - `true`: Statsig maintains a local rolling window of the last 30 seconds of the session, allowing recordings to include context leading up to a trigger.
  - `false`: If a conditional trigger occurs, recording begins from that moment onward, with no historical context.

## Advanced: Forcing a Recording on Demand

You may have a use case where you need to make sure a session is recorded (based on a trigger, or a particular user that has interesting characteristics or behavior). To do this, we offer the forceStartRecording API which will begin recording as soon as you call it.

If you are just getting set up - just follow the installation guide on the previous page. But if there is a specific trigger in your app you want to force recording, you can do the following:

```
if (someCondition) {
  new SessionReplay(client).forceStartRecording();
}
```

## Configure Recording Privacy/PII Options

If your users may be entering or viewing sensitive information, you can prevent this from being recorded and displayed using [CSS classes offered by the rrweb recorder](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb/blob/master/guide.md#privacy) (the open source recording tool we use).

- `input[type="password"]` will be masked by default.
- An element with the class name `.rr-block` will not be recorded. Instead, it will replay as a placeholder with the same dimensions.
- An element with the class name `.rr-ignore` will not record its input events.
- All text of elements with the class name `.rr-mask` and their children will be masked.

We plan to provide 1st class integration of privacy controls with the Statsig SDK as we roll out of beta.

## Limits

### 4 Hours Per Session or 30 Min Inactive Time

Sessions will end after four hours total or if the user returns from inactive time greater than 30 minutes later.

### 50,000 Sessions Per Month

Every Statsig project can store up to 50,000 sessions per month, after which time the SDK will stop further recordings from taking place by preventing clients from taking new recordings. You can check how many replays you have used in your org settings:

### **Replay Availability Time**

It can currently take about 1 hour from when the session is recorded to seeing it in your Statsig console. We are working to bring this time down in the next few weeks.

### 30 Day Retention

While we are in beta, Sessions have a 30 day lifetime and will be deleted after 30 days.
