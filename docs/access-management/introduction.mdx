Statsig provides a few different solutions for access management as you scale out adoption in your team/org/company.

We have simple settings like automatically adding new users with the same email domain to your project, but we also offer SSO to simplify the process for inviting your team to your Projects.

To get started, learn more about Statsig's [organization](/access-management/organizations) and [project](/access-management/projects) abstractions.

Then, if you're looking for SSO, read our [SSO docs](/access-management/sso/overview).
