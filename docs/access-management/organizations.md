## Creating an Organization

Statsig creates an organization for companies with an Enterprise contract.

When you move a project to the organization, 
 - All existing **members** will receive an invitation to join the organization 
 - All existing project **administrators** will remain the same 
 - The project will be added as **Open** i.e. any registered Statsig user with the same email domain as the project owner will have access to the project; you can change this setting in the **Project Settings** tab

If you don't move a project to the organization, you may lose access to it as it will be archived. 

## Managing Organizations

Creating an organization will automatically make you the organization's **Owner** and **Admin**. 

You can view your Organization page by navigating to [Account Settings](https://console.statsig.com/account_settings)
and clicking on **Manage** next to your organization.

You can also navigate to the Organization page by clicking on your name/email at the top right of the console, and clicking on **Your Organization** from the drop down.
