## Discussions
Feature rollout and experimentation are collaborative exercises where teams work together. Often this collaboration requires people taking screenshots, looking at metrics and DMing team mates to ask them questions. This information is siloed and lost to others. In-context Discussions allow teams to discuss aspects of the feature rollout or experiment while making this context available to other team members. Common reasons include discussing a surprising metric lift, asking questions on validation performed before ramping up a feature rollout or even keeping a running log of observations/escalations that can be referenced when the experiment is complete.
