## Common Issues

- I'm not seeing any Statsig groups in Okta
  - Your organization may have the Okta flag `SELECTIVE_APP_IMPORT_PLATFORM` enabled. If this is the case, you will need to select `Import Groups` in the SCIM integration settings. See the [setup page](/access-management/scim/okta_scim_setup) for more info.
- I can't select `Import Groups` in the SCIM integration settings
  - Your organization may have the Okta flag `SELECTIVE_APP_IMPORT_PLATFORM` disabled. If this is the case, you cannot select `Import Groups` in the SCIM integration settings. However, when importing you will see the groups in the Okta SCIM integration.
- I'm trying to push groups but not seeing users populate those groups
  - Ensure that the users you are pushing to Statsig are assigned to the integration.
  - If the users are assigned, verify that the groups you are pushing to Statsig are the Statsig Groups generated on import.
- I don't want to use Statsig generated groups, can I use my own?
  - You can use your own groups in the push groups section. However, you will need to push these groups to a specific Statsig Project x Role Group. There is no way to push your own groups without pushing to a Statsig Project x Role Group.
