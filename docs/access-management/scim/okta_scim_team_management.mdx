## Import Existing Statsig Teams

:::note
Teams are specific Statsig groups that exist within projects. They are not shared across projects. They also have two possible roles: `Admin` and `Member`.
:::

## Setup
- Ensure you have some teams created in Statsig.
- Navigate to the Statsig Project and create a team if you have none.

## Import Existing Groups

- In Okta, go to the Statsig app's "Import" tab
- Click "Import Now" to fetch existing Statsig users, groups, and teams
- After importing, you should see the group in your Okta groups following the format `Statsig-ProjectName-TeamName-RoleName`.

## Create a Mapping Group

- To push a group of Okta users to a Statsig team, you must first create a mapping group.
- This group will contain the Okta members which will be part of the Team x Role Group.

## Push Teams to Statsig

1. In Okta, go to the Statsig Integration's "Push Teams" tab and select "Push Groups". Then pick the mapping group created in the previous step.

3. When you are finished setting up the push, click "Save".

## Verify the Push

- Navigate to the Statsig Project and verify that the team has the new members.
- This could take some time for Okta to push the members to the team.

- When prompted to delete the group or leave it in the app, select "Delete".
- After Okta pushes the deletion, the team should be deleted from Statsig. This may take a few minutes to complete.
