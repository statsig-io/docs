# Okta SCIM Provisioning

This guide outlines the process for setting up SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) integration between Statsig and Okta. This integration allows for automated user provisioning and management.

## Prerequisites

- An Okta account with admin access
- A SCIM Key from Statsig. Contact us to request for a new SCIM key.

## Step 1: Create a New App Integration in Okta

- Log in to your Okta admin console
- Navigate to Applications > Applications > Create App Integration
- Select "SWA - Secure Web Authentication"

## Step 2: Configure App Settings

- Set the App name to "Statsig SCIM"
- Enter a placeholder URL for the App Login Page (this is a required field but not used for SCIM)

## Step 3: Enable SCIM Provisioning

- After creating the integration, go to the "General" tab
- Click on "Edit" in the "Provisioning" section
- Enable "SCIM Provisioning"

## Step 4: Configure SCIM Settings

- Navigate to the "Provisioning" tab
- Set the SCIM connector base URL to: [https://statsigapi.net/scim](https://statsigapi.net/scim)
- Set "Unique identifier field for users" to "userName"
- Enable
  - `Import New Users and Profile Update`
  - `Push New Users`
  - `Push Profile Updates`
- Set the authentication mode to "HTTP Header"
- For the authorization header, use the SCIM Bearer token provided to you by statsig

## Step 5: Configure Okta to Statsig Settings

- Enable "Create Users"
- Enable "Deactivate Users"
- Do not enable "Update User Attributes" or "Sync Password"

## Step 6: Import Existing Statsig Users

- In Okta, go to the Statsig app's "Import" tab
- Click "Import Now" to fetch existing Statsig users
- Process the imported users as needed

## Step 7: Manage User Assignments

- Use the "Assignments" tab in Okta to add or remove users from Statsig
- Adding a user assignment in Okta will create the user in Statsig, while removing the assignment will deactivate the user's Statsig account

## Important Notes

- User full name, password, and email management is not enabled on SCIM yet.
- Project and role management is still a work in progress. Some groups will populate on Okta, we ask that you do not use them for now.
- The Org Owner cannot be removed via SCIM, it will throw an error. This is prevent accidents on the Okta side.
- When a user is removed from Statsig, they will be automatically unassigned in Okta. Conversely, if a user is unassigned or deactivated in Okta, they will be removed from the Statsig Organization.
- Role management for users at the org level must still be done via Statsig. We will implement org role management on Okta soon.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the SCIM Bearer token is correctly entered and has not expired
- Check Okta's System Log for any synchronization errors
- Verify that user attributes are correctly mapped between Okta and Statsig
