# Provision Statsig users with SCIM

<Alert severity="info">
  SCIM is currently a work in progress feature and in Closed Beta. For any
  questions or support, feel free to reach out to us through Slack.
</Alert>

SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is a standardized protocol that simplifies the automation of user provisioning and management across multiple platforms.
By integrating SCIM with your preferred Identity Provider (IdP), such as Okta or Microsoft Entra,
you can securely and efficiently manage user creation, updates, and de-provisioning within Statsig.
We currently only offer an Okta SCIM integration.

### Current SCIM Offering

We are actively developing SCIM functionality and have rolled out the following features:

- Statsig Org level provisioning: Create new users and deactivate existing users in Statsig
- Statsig Org User Imports: Import existing users on Statsig to Idp

### Features Currently Not Available

The following features are under development and will be released in future updates

- Statsig Org level role management: Users can be assigned to organization roles in Statsig
- Statsig Project level provisioning: Users can be assigned to projects and roles in Statsig

### Changelog

See our current [Changelog](/docs/access-management/scim/scim_changelog.md) for the latest updates on SCIM functionality.

## Okta

This guide outlines the process for setting up SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) integration between Statsig and Okta. This integration allows for automated user provisioning and management.

## Prerequisites

- An Okta account with admin access
- A SCIM Key from Statsig. Contact us to request for a new SCIM key.

## Step 1: Create a New App Integration in Okta

- Log in to your Okta admin console
- Navigate to Applications > Applications > Create App Integration
- Select "SWA - Secure Web Authentication"

## Step 2: Configure App Settings

- Set the App name to "Statsig SCIM"
- Enter a placeholder URL for the App Login Page (this is a required field but not used for SCIM)

## Step 3: Enable SCIM Provisioning

- After creating the integration, go to the "General" tab
- Click on "Edit" in the "Provisioning" section
- Enable "SCIM Provisioning"

## Step 4: Configure SCIM Settings

- Navigate to the "Provisioning" tab
- Set the SCIM connector base URL to: [https://statsigapi.net/scim](https://statsigapi.net/scim)
- Set "Unique identifier field for users" to "userName"
- Enable
  - `Import New Users and Profile Update`
  - `Push New Users`
  - `Push Profile Updates`
- Set the authentication mode to "HTTP Header"
- For the authorization header, use the SCIM Bearer token provided to you by statsig

## Step 5: Configure Okta to Statsig Settings

- Enable "Create Users"
- Enable "Deactivate Users"
- Do not enable "Update User Attributes" or "Sync Password"

## Step 6: Import Existing Statsig Users

- In Okta, go to the Statsig app's "Import" tab
- Click "Import Now" to fetch existing Statsig users
- Process the imported users as needed

## Step 7: Manage User Assignments

- Use the "Assignments" tab in Okta to add or remove users from Statsig
- Assigning a user will add them to Statsig; unassigning will deactivate them in Statsig

## Important Notes

- User full name, password, and email management is not enabled on SCIM yet.
- Project and role management is still a work in progress. Some groups will populate on Okta, we ask that you do not use them for now.
- The Org Owner cannot be removed via SCIM, it will throw an error. This is prevent accidents on the Okta side.
- Removing a user on Statsig will unassign them on Okta. Unassigning/deactivating a user on Okta will remove them from the Statsig Org.
- Role management for users at the org level must still be done via Statsig. We will implement org role management on Okta soon.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the SCIM Bearer token is correctly entered and has not expired
- Check Okta's System Log for any synchronization errors
- Verify that user attributes are correctly mapped between Okta and Statsig
