4. Type in and select the Okta group that will push to a Statsig Project x Role Group.

- You can find Groups in left nav of Okta: `Directory > Groups`. In there, you will see the groups created from Okta and groups created by Statsig.
- The required groups are groups you created from Okta. You can filter by choosing `Group source type` and set to `Okta groups`. If you don't have any, go ahead and create it with members as well.

5. Now let's link/assign Okta group you created from Okta to the Statsig groups with role you want.

- Change `Match Result & Push Action` to `Link Group`

6. Select the Statsig Project x Role Group that the Okta group will push to.

- We display the Statsig Project x Role Group with the format `Statsig-<Project Name>-<Role Name>` on Okta.
- By default Okta only allows you to map 1 Okta Group to 1 Statsig Group.

7. Then link the Okta group to a Statsig Project x Role Group. On save the group should push to Statsig. All future group changes on Okta will be pushed to Statsig.
