## Introduction

SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is a standardized protocol that simplifies the automation of user provisioning and management across multiple platforms.
By integrating SCIM with your preferred Identity Provider (IdP), such as Okta or Microsoft Entra,
you can securely and efficiently manage user creation, updates, and de-provisioning within Statsig.
We currently only offer an Okta SCIM integration.

## Current SCIM Offering

We are actively developing SCIM functionality and have rolled out the following features:

- Statsig Org level provisioning: Create new users and deactivate existing users in Statsig
- Okta Full Name Sync: Full Name synced from Okta to Statsig
- Statsig Org User Imports: Import existing users on Statsig to Idp
- Okta Org Role management: Users' organization roles can be managed in Okta
- Okta Project Role management: Users' project roles can be managed in Okta

## Features Currently Not Available

The following features are under development and will be released in future updates

- Statsig Team level provisioning: Users can be assigned to teams and roles in Statsig
