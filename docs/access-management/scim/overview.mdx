# SCIM User Provisioning

## Introduction

SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is a standardized protocol that simplifies the automation of user provisioning and management across multiple platforms.
By integrating SCIM with your preferred Identity Provider (IdP), such as Okta,
you can securely and efficiently manage user creation, updates, and de-provisioning within Statsig.
We currently only offer an Okta SCIM integration.

## How To Obtain SCIM Auth Key

:::info

The SCIM key includes the `scim` prefix.

1. Navigate to Organization Access Management:
   Go to Settings > Organization > Organization Info > Access Management.
2. Generate a Key:
   If SCIM is not yet enabled, generate a new authentication key.
3. Deactivate the Key:
   To disable the key, select Deactivate.
4. Regenerate the Key:
   If you suspect the key has been compromised, you can regenerate a new one to replace it.

## Current SCIM Offering

We are actively developing SCIM functionality and have rolled out the following features:

- Statsig Org level provisioning: Create new users and deactivate existing users in Statsig
- Okta Full Name Sync: Full Name synced from Okta to Statsig
- Statsig Org User Imports: Import existing users on Statsig to Idp
- Okta Org Role management: Users' organization roles can be managed in Okta
- Okta Project Role management: Users' project roles can be managed in Okta
- Okta Team x Role Management: Users can be assigned to teams and roles in Statsig via Okta SCIM
