## Introduction
SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is a standardized protocol that simplifies the automation of user provisioning and management across multiple platforms.
By integrating SCIM with your preferred Identity Provider (IdP), such as Okta or Microsoft Entra,
you can securely and efficiently manage user creation, updates, and de-provisioning within Statsig.
We currently only offer an Okta SCIM integration.

## Current SCIM Offering
We are actively developing SCIM functionality and have rolled out the following features:

- Statsig Org level provisioning: Create new users and deactivate existing users in Statsig
- Statsig Org User Imports: Import existing users on Statsig to Idp

## Features Currently Not Available
The following features are under development and will be released in future updates

- Statsig Org level role management: Users can be assigned to organization roles in Statsig
- Statsig Project level provisioning: Users can be assigned to projects and roles in Statsig
