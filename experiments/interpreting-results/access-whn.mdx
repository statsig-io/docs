## How to Access Pulse Data in Warehouse Native

WHN lets you access exposures and metric results across all experiments directly in your warehouse through SQL Views defined in your Statsig project through a metric source. 

### Exposures
Exposures are automatically written to your warehouse to the table configured in your project setup. You can find the table's location by going to Settings > Data Connection. The table should be located at the `{Database Name}.{Schema Name}.{Exposures Forwarding Table Name}`, e.g. `experimentation.statsig.exposures`.

### Results
With a SQL View, you have access to values that include experiment metadata like experiment team, experiment tags, target duration, and experiment settings like CUPED and Sequential testing, then each metric’s metadata like metric tags, and all of the metric lifts-same set of results you see on the Console copy. If you want to start using this feature, simply enable it in your project setting Project Settings > Data Connection > Export. Once you have this enabled, we will automatically handle the setup of SQL view in your warehouse as well as the metric source in your Statsig project. We will then automatically export scorecard metric results to your data warehouse each time an experiment is loaded.

### Schema of the Results Data Export Table
The default table name used is statsig_daily_results. When exports are enabled, Statsig also autocreates a metric source with this name in your Statsig project.

## Report Types

There are three types of exports:

1. Exposures - A table of all exposed users and their first exposures. This is useful for joining on your own internal data, and running custom queries within your own data warehouse. This can also be used to verify who was in the experiment, what group they were assigned to, and when they were first exposed (around 1-25MB). This will contain:
   1. `<experiment\>_first_exposures.csv` - contains a list of users and their first exposure to the experiment.
2. Pulse Summary - This provides precomputed summary experimental data for all metrics and test groups including everything that's visible on Pulse (**around 10-100 kb**). This will contain:

   1. `<experiment\>_pulse_summary.csv` - contains Pulse aggregate metrics computed over the duration of the experiment.

3. Raw Data - This provides raw exposures and metrics data at the user-day level. This is best used for manually inspecting data, or recomputing your own statistics (**around 10MB-1GB**). This will contain:
   1. `<experiment\>_first_exposures.csv` - contains a list of users and their first exposure to the experiment. If this is the only file you are interested in, you can get this by exporting an "Exposures" report which will be much smaller in size.
   2. `<experiment\>_user_metrics.csv` - contains a list of experimental users, and their calculated metrics for each day they were enrolled in the experiment.

In WHN, only the Pulse Summary may be exported, as the other two types of data are only stored [in your warehouse](https://docs.statsig.com/statsig-warehouse-native/pipeline-overview/#artifacts-and-entity-relationships). The availability of these exports are subject to our retention policy. We hold exposures data for up-to 90 days after an experiment is concluded. We hold raw user-level metrics data for 90 days.
