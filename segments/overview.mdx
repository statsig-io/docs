description: Learn how to create and use segments to define reusable sets of users for targeting across features and dynamic configs

## What is a segment?
A segment defines a reusable set of users. You can define a segment based on common user attributes such as location, client device, browser, client application version, or simply using user IDs. 


## When to use segments?
Segments are ideal for targeting a commonly identified set of users across features or dynamic configs. For example, you may create a segment of users that represent your team members or company employees to test a new feature with your colleagues before launching to external users. You may also create different segments of users for English and Spanish speaking countries to deliver a dynamically configured, localized application experience to each geographically identified segment of users.

To get started, see the Statsig guide to [create your first segment](/guides/first-segment).

The following tutorials show how you can perform common tasks with segments.
