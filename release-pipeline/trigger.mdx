A Release Pipeline is activated when you make changes to a feature gate or dynamic config that has a pipeline attached to it.

## Attaching a Pipeline

Before triggering a release, you must first attach a pipeline to your feature gate or dynamic config. The Statsig console offers two methods for attaching a Release Pipeline.

### During Feature Creation

You can select a Release Pipeline directly in the creation modal when setting up a new feature gate or dynamic config:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/release-pipeline/modal-attach.png" alt="Attaching a pipeline during creation" />
</Frame>

### To an Existing Feature

For an existing feature gate or dynamic config, you can attach a Release Pipeline through the sidebar settings:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/release-pipeline/sidebar-attach.png" alt="Attaching a pipeline via sidebar" />
</Frame>

:::note
You must have at least one Release Pipeline created before it will appear in the dropdown menu. See [Create and Manage Pipelines](/release-pipeline/create-and-manage) for instructions on creating pipelines.

## Starting a Rollout

When a Release Pipeline is attached, making changes to your feature gate or dynamic config will automatically initiate the pipeline process:

1. Make your desired changes to the feature gate or dynamic config
2. Click **Save** to commit the changes
3. A confirmation dialog will appear, informing you that changes will progress through the pipeline
4. Review the information and click **Confirm** to proceed

The system will then begin the rollout following the phases defined in the attached pipeline.

</Frame>

## Viewing Release Status

Once a Release Pipeline is triggered, you can monitor its progress:

1. At the top of the feature gate or dynamic config page, a status banner will appear
2. This banner displays the current phase and overall progress through the pipeline

  <img src="/images/release-pipeline/view-status.png" alt="Status banner showing release progress" />
</Frame>

For information about controlling an ongoing release, including approvals and aborts, see [Managing Release Actions](/release-pipeline/actions).

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I attach different Release Pipelines to different feature gates?**  
A: Yes, each feature gate or dynamic config can use a different pipeline based on its specific rollout needs. However, a single feature gate or dynamic config can only have one Release Pipeline attached at a time.

**Q: What happens if I need to cancel a release in progress?**  
A: You can abort an ongoing release using the actions menu in the release details view. See [Managing Release Actions](/release-pipeline/actions) for complete instructions on how to abort a release.
