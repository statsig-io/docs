## Introduction

SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is a standardized protocol that simplifies the automation of user provisioning and management across multiple platforms.
By integrating SCIM with your preferred Identity Provider (IdP), such as Okta,
you can securely and efficiently manage user creation, updates, and de-provisioning within Statsig.
We currently only offer an Okta SCIM integration.

## How To Obtain SCIM Auth Key

<Info>
The SCIM key includes the `scim` prefix.

1. Navigate to Organization Access Management:
   Go to Settings > Organization > Organization Info > Access Management.
2. Generate a Key:
   If SCIM is not yet enabled, generate a new authentication key.
3. Deactivate the Key:
   To disable the key, select Deactivate.
4. Regenerate the Key:
   If you suspect the key has been compromised, you can regenerate a new one to replace it.
