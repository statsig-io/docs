## Import Existing Statsig Teams

<Note>
Teams are specific Statsig groups that exist within projects. They are not shared across projects. They also have two possible roles: `Admin` and `Member`.
</Note>

## Setup
- Ensure you have some teams created in Statsig.
- Navigate to the Statsig Project and create a team if you have none.

## Import Existing Groups

- In Okta, go to the Statsig app's "Import" tab
- Click "Import Now" to fetch existing Statsig users, groups, and teams
- After importing, you should see the group in your Okta groups following the format `Statsig-ProjectName-TeamName-RoleName`.

## Create a Mapping Group

- To push a group of Okta users to a Statsig team, you must first create a mapping group.
- This group will contain the Okta members which will be part of the Team x Role Group.

3. When you are finished setting up the push, click "Save".

## Verify the Push

- Navigate to the Statsig Project and verify that the team has the new members.
- This could take some time for Okta to push the members to the team.
