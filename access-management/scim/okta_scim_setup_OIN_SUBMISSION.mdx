⚠️⚠️ This is required documentation for our official Okta integration submission. For now, please reference the existing guide at [Setup](okta_scim_setup)

This guide outlines the process for setting up SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity
Management) integration between Statsig and Okta. This integration allows for automated
user provisioning and management.

## Prerequisites

- An Okta account with admin access
- A SCIM Key from the [Statsig Console](/access-management/scim/overview#how-to-obtain-scim-auth-key) (requires Statsig Org Admin rights)

<Note>

### Integration Notes

- User email management is not enabled on SCIM yet.
- When a user is removed from Statsig, they will be automatically unassigned in Okta. Conversely, if a user is unassigned or deactivated in Okta, they will be removed from the Statsig Organization.
- Creation of Statsig Projects and Roles is not supported via SCIM.
</Note>

## Step 1: Add the Statsig App from the Okta App Catalog

- Log in to your Okta admin console
- Navigate to Applications > Applications > Browse App Catalog

## Step 2: Enable API Integration
- Navigate to the "Provisioning" tab of the generated app -> Select "Enable API Integration"
- For the API Token, use the SCIM Bearer token generated in Statsig by your Org Admin. See [How to Obtain SCIM Auth Key](/access-management/scim/overview#how-to-obtain-scim-auth-key) for more details.
- **⚠️Important⚠️** Prepend "Bearer " to the token obtained from Statsig, e.g. "Bearer scim-G22A***"
