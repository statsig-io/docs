title: "WHN Usage-Based Pricing Model"
---

<Info>
Applies to Warehouse Native customers on the usage-based (credit) pricing model only.

The instructions below describe how to view credit usage under Statsig's new consumption-based pricing.
</Info>

_Note: Screenshots below are from a sample account. Your view may differ based on your rate and usage._

You can view credit usage in two places:

- The **Statsig Console**
- The **Orb billing portal**

Both show your total credit balance and usage by SKU.

## Statsig Console

Use the Statsig Console to view high-level credit usage and monthly invoices.

1. Log in to the [Statsig Console](https://console.statsig.com/)
2. Open **Settings**
3. Go to **Manage Account → Usage & Billing**
4. At the top of the page, you'll see your total credit balance
5. Below the total, you can view credit usage by SKU, along with current and past invoice and usage details (similar view to Orb)

## Orb Portal

Use Orb for detailed usage breakdowns and automated alerts.

<Info>
Orb is used for visibility and alerts only. You will not be auto-charged or invoiced through Orb. Any credit top-ups are handled directly by the Statsig team.
</Info>

1. **Log into your Orb account**

2. **View your total credit balance** - Under **Account Information**, you'll see your total credit balance.

### Experiment Analysis Unit (EAU) usage

EAUs are billed when an experiment ends. As a result, EAU usage may appear as a single spike rather than daily usage.
