title: Tags in Statsig
---

## Tags for organization
Tags let you apply light-weight organization to your Statsig config (e.g. gates, experiments and metrics) to allow easy filtering by team (or organization objectives). E.g. You can tag growth related experiments and metrics with a tag called "Growth", easily filtering down to just these when needed. This is particularly useful with metrics - since you can now just add the Growth tag to your scorecard metrics, and pull in all the key Growth metrics instead of individually picking them.

The Core tag is meant to be used for company critical metrics. These are defaulted into experiment scorecards so experimenters are looking at impact on these metrics as part of their experiments.
