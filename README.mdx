## Contributing to docs

Community contributions are welcome. Statsig's docs run on [Mintlify](https://www.mintlify.com/). Open a PR and request a review in our [Slack channel](https://statsig.com/slack) to merge your change in.

There are two ways to contribute: 
1. Open a Pull Request on Github (via local dev, or by editing in the Github UI)
2. Use the Mintlify Visual Editor (Statsig Employees Only)

If you're used to docs-as-code or our old docusaurus setup, #1 is probably the right path - see below for local development instructions. If you'd prefer a snazzy visual interface, message Brock on slack to get setup with a Visual Editor account. 

### Local development:

```
npm i -g mintlify
mintlify dev
```

## Differences from Docusaurus

Mintlify's overall structure will feel very similar to Statsig's old Docusaurus docs - Its still docs-as-code with .mdx files and similar title/description formatting (frontmatter) as before. You can also still import reusable snippets, with the one wrinkle that they have to be in the /snippets folder. 

### Component differences: 
You'll notice minor component syntax differences in Mintlify:
1. The format of [Callouts](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/components/callouts#callouts) has changed. Where you used to write :::Note Insert my note text :::, you now wrap your text in \<Note\> and \</Note\>.
2. The format of a lot of other components has had minor changes. For example, what was \<Tabs\> \<TabItem\> \</TabItem\> \</Tabs\> is now \<Tabs\> \<Tab\> \</Tab\> \</Tabs\> in Mintlify. You should scan the [Mintlify docs](https://www.mintlify.com/docs) to see all of the cool elements they have.
3. [Code groups](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/components/code-groups) are a lot snazzier, and we've migrated a lot of our old Tab usage to Code groups.
4. You can't use quite as much React-like syntax as Docusaurus, you won't want to do things like have named exports.

### Spellcheck

You can find the allowlist of non-dictionary words in styles/config/vocabularies/Mintlify/accept.txt. Add words here as needed, similar to cspell.json in old docs.

#### Troubleshooting

- Mintlify dev isn't running - Run `mintlify install` it'll re-install dependencies.
- Page loads as a 404 - Make sure you are running in a folder with `docs.json`
